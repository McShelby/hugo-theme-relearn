    "content": "This document shows you what’s new in the latest release. For a detailed list of changes, see the history page.\nBreaking: A change that requires action by you after upgrading to assure the site is still functional.\nChange: A change in default behavior. This may requires action by you / may or may not be revertable by configuration.\nNew: Marks new behavior you might find interesting or comes configurable.\n5.0.0 Change: The way archetypes are used to generate output has changed. The new systems allows you, to redefine existing archetypes or even generate your own ones.\nYour existing markdown files will still work like before and therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade. Nevertheless, it is recommended to adapt your existing markdown files to the new way as follows:\nfor your home page, add the frontmatter parameter archetype = \"home\" and remove the leading heading\nfor all files containing the deprecated frontmatter parameter chapter = true, replace it with archetype = \"chapter\" and remove the leading headings\nChange: The frontmatter options pre / post were renamed to menuPre / menuPost. The old options will still be used if the new options aren’t set. Therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade.\nNew: Adding new partials heading-pre.html / heading-post.html and according frontmatter options headingPre / headingPost to modifiy the way your page`s main heading gets styled.\nNew: The new shortcode math is available to add beautiful math and chemical formulae. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n4.2.0 Breaking: The second parameter for the include shortcode was switched in meaning and was renamed from showfirstheading to hidefirstheading. If you haven’t used this parameter in your shortcode, the default behavior hasn’t changed and you don’t need to change anything.\nIf you’ve used the second boolean parameter, you have to rename it and invert its value to achive the same behavior.\nChange: Previously, if the tabs shortcode could not find a tab item because, the tabs ended up empty. Now the first tab is selected instead.\nChange: The landingPageURL was removed from config.toml. You can savely remove this aswell from your configuration as it is not used anymore. The theme will detect the landing page URL automatically.\nNew: All shortcodes can now be also called from your partials. Examples for this are added to the documentation of each shortcode.\n4.1.0 New: While fixing issues with the search functionality for non latin languages, you can now configure to have multiple languages on a single page. 4.0.0 Breaking: The custom_css config parameter was removed from the configuration. If used in an existing installation, it can be achieved by overriding the custom-header.html template in a much more generic manner.\nBreaking: Because anchor hover color was not configurable without introducing more complexitity to the variant stylesheets, we decided to remove --MAIN-ANCHOR-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the anchors now get their colors from --MAIN-LINK-color and --MAIN-ANCHOR-HOVER-color respectivley.\nNew: All shortcodes now support named parameter. The positional parameter are still supported but will not be enhanced with new features, so you don’t need to change anything in your installation.\nThis applies to expand, include, notice and siteparam.\nNew: The button shortcode received some love and now has a parameter for the color style similar to other shortcodes.\nNew: New colors --PRIMARY-color and --SECONDARY-color were added to provide easier modification of your custom style. Shortcodes with a color style can now have primary or secondary as additional values.\nThese two colors are the default for other, more specific color variables. You don’t need to change anything in your existing custom color stylesheets as those variables get reasonable default values.\nNew: The documentation for all shortcodes were revised.\n3.4.0 Breaking: If you had previously overwritten the custom-footer.html partial to add visual elements below the content of your page, you have to move this content to the new partial content-footer.html. custom-footer.html was never meant to contain HTML other than additional styles and JavaScript.\nNew: If you prefer expandable/collapsible menu items, you can now set collapsibleMenu=true in your config.toml. This will add arrows to all menu items that contain sub menus. The menu will expand/collapse without navigation if you click on an arrow.\nNew: You can activate print support in your config.toml to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site.\nNew: Translation for Traditional Chinese.\n3.3.0 New: Introduction of new CSS variables to set the font. The theme distinguishs between --MAIN-font for all content text and --CODE-font for inline or block code. There are additional overrides for all headings. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for all available variables.\nNew: The new shortcode swagger is available to include a UI for REST OpenAPI Specifications. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n3.2.0 Change: In this release the Mermaid JavaScript library will only be loaded on demand if the page contains a Mermaid shortcode or is using Mermaid codefences. This changes the behavior of disableMermaid config option as follows: If a Mermaid shortcode or codefence is found, the option will be ignored and Mermaid will be loaded regardlessly.\nThe option is still useful in case you are using scripting to set up your graph. In this case no shortcode or codefence is involved and the library is not loaded by default. In this case you can set disableMermaid=false in your frontmatter to force the library to be loaded. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for an example.\nThis change requires at least Hugo 0.93.0 to be used. The minimum requirement will be reported during build on the console if not met.\nNew: Additional color variant variable --MERMAID-theme to set the variant’s Mermaid theme. This causes the Mermaid theme to switch with the color variant if it defers from the setting of the formerly selected color variant.\n3.1.0 New: attachment and notice shortcodes have a new parameter to override the default icon. Allowed values are all Font Awesome 5 Free icons. 3.0.0 Breaking: We made changes to the menu footer. If you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may have to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) in your partial. For a reference take a look into the menu-footer.html partial that is coming with the exampleSite.\nThis change was made to allow your own menu footer to be placed right after the so called prefooter that comes with the theme (containing the language switch and Clear history functionality).\nBreaking: We have changed the default colors from the original Learn theme (the purple menu header) to the Relearn defaults (the light green menu header) as used in the official documentation.\nThis change will only affect your installation if you’ve not set the themeVariant parameter in your config.toml. If you still want to use the Learn color variant, you have to explicitly set themeVariant=\"learn\" in your config.toml.\nNote, that this will also affect your site if viewed with Internet Explorer 11 but in this case it can not be reconfigured as Internet Explorer does not support CSS variables.\nChange: Due to a bug, that we couldn’t fix in a general manner for color variants, we decided to remove --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-ICONS-color and introduced --MENU-SEARCH-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange: For consistency reasons, we renamed --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-color to --MENU-SEARCH-BORDER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew: With this release you are now capable to define your own dark mode variants.\nTo make this possible, we have introduced a lot more color variables you can use in your color variants. Your old variants will still work and don’t need to be changed as apropriate fallback values are used by the theme. Nevertheless, the new colors allow for much more customization.\nTo see what’s now possible, see the new variants relearn-dark and neon that are coming with this release.\nNew: To make the creation of new variants easier for you, we’ve added a new interactive theme variant generator. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\nNew: You can now configure multiple color variants in your config.toml. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant switch will be shown in the menu footer. See the documentation for configuration.\nNote, that the new variant switch will not work with Internet Explorer 11 as it does not support CSS variables. Therefore, the variant switcher will not be displayed with Internet Explorer 11.\n2.9.0 Breaking: This release removes the themes implementation of ref/relref in favor for Hugos standard implementation. This is because of inconsistencies with the themes implementation. In advantage, your project becomes standard complient and exchanging this theme in your project to some other theme will be effortless.\nIn a standard complient form you must not link to the *.md file but to its logical name. You’ll see, referencing other pages becomes much easier. All three types result in the same reference:\nType Non-Standard Standard Branch bundle basics/configuration/_index.md basics/configuration Leaf bundle basics/configuration/index.md basics/configuration Page basics/configuration.md basics/configuration If you’ve linked from a page of one language to a page of another language, conversion is a bit more difficult but Hugo got you covered as well.\nAlso, the old themes implementation allowed refs to non-existing content. This will cause Hugos implementation to show the error below and abort the generation. If your project relies on this old behavior, you can reconfigure the error handling of Hugos implementation.\nIn the best case your usage of the old implementation is already standard complient and you don’t need to change anything. You’ll notice this very easily once you’ve started hugo server after an upgrade and no errors are written to the console.\nYou may see errors on the console after the update in the form:\nERROR 2021/11/19 22:29:10 [en] REF_NOT_FOUND: Ref \"basics/configuration/_index.md\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\\exampleSite\\content\\_index.en.md:19:22\": page not found In this case, you must apply one of two options:\nCopy the old implementation files theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/ref.html and theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/relref.html to your own projects layouts/shortcode/ref.html and layouts/shortcode/relref.html respectively. This is not recommended as your project will still rely on non-standard behavior afterwards.\nStart up a text editor with regular expression support for search and replace. Apply the following conversions in the given order on all *.md files. This is the recommended choice.\nType Search Replace by Branch bundle (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*)/_index\\.md\" $1\" Leaf bundle (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*)/index\\.md\" $1\" Page (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*)\\.md\" $1\" 2.8.0 Change: Although never officially documented, this release removes the font Novacento/Novecento. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with Work Sans. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for czech.\nNew: The theme now supports favicons served from static/images/ named as favicon or logo in SVG, PNG or ICO format out of the box. An overridden partial layouts/partials/favicon.html may not be necessary anymore in most cases.\nNew: You can hide the table of contents menu for the whole site by setting the disableToc option in your config.toml. For an example see the example configuration.\n2.7.0 New: Optional second parameter for notice shortcode to set title in box header. 2.6.0 New: Your site can now be served from a subfolder if you set baseURL and canonifyURLs=true in your config.toml. See the documentation for a detailed example. 2.5.0 Change: New colors --CODE-BLOCK-color and --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color were added to provide a fallback for Hugos syntax highlightning in case guessSyntax=true is set. Ideally the colors are set to the same values as the ones from your chosen chroma style. 2.4.0 Change: Creation of customized stylesheets was simplified down to only contain the CSS variables. Everything else can and should be deleted from your custom stylesheet to assure everything works fine. For the predefined stylesheet variants, this change is already included.\nNew: Hidden pages are displayed by default in their according tags page. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableTagHiddenPages=true in your config.toml.\nNew: You can define the expansion state of your menus for the whole site by setting the alwaysopen option in your config.toml. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew: New frontmatter ordersectionsby option to change immediate children sorting in menu and children shortcode. Possible values are title or weight.\nNew: Alternate content of a page is now advertised in the HTML meta tags. See Hugo documentation.\n2.3.0 New: Showcase multilanguage features by provding a documentation translation “fer us pirrrates”. There will be no other translations besides the original English one and the Pirates one due to maintenance constraints. 2.2.0 New: Hidden pages are displayed by default in the sitemap generated by Hugo and are therefore visible for search engine indexing. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSeoHiddenPages=true in your config.toml. 2.1.0 Change: In case the site’s structure contains addional *.md files not part of the site (eg files that are meant to be included by site pages - see CHANGELOG.md in the exampleSite), they will now be ignored by the search.\nNew: Hidden pages are indexed for the site search by default. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSearchHiddenPages=true in your config.toml.\nNew: If a search term is found in an expand shortcode, the expand will be opened.\nNew: The menu will scroll the active item into view on load.\n2.0.0 Change: Syntaxhighlightning was switched to the built in Hugo mechanism. You may need to configure a new stylesheet or decide to roll you own as described on in the Hugo documentation\nChange: In the predefined stylesheets there was a typo and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVERED-color must be changed to --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange: --MENU-HOME-LINK-color and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color were missing in the documentation. You should add them to your custom stylesheets if you want to override the defaults.\nChange: Arrow navigation and children shortcode were ignoring setting for ordersectionsby. This is now changed and may result in different sorting order of your sub pages.\nChange: If hidden pages are accessed directly by typing their URL, they will be exposed in the menu.\nChange: A page without a title will be treated as hidden=true.\nNew: You can define the expansion state of your menus in the frontmatter. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew: New partials for defining pre/post content for menu items and the content. See documentation for further reading.\nNew: Shortcode children with new parameter containerstyle.\nNew: New shortcode include to include arbitrary file content into a page.\n1.2.0 New: Shortcode expand with new parameter to open on page load. 1.1.0 New: Mermaid config options can be set in config.toml. 1.0.0 New: Initial fork of the Learn theme based on Learn 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01. This introduces no new features besides a global rename to Relearn and a new logo. For the reasons behind forking the Learn theme, see this comment in the Learn issues. ",

If you don’t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following great documentation for beginners.\nHugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u003cnew_project\u003e The Relearn theme provides archetypes to help you create this kind of pages.\nFrontmatter Configuration Each Hugo page has to define a frontmatter in toml, yaml or json. This site will use toml in all cases.\nThe Relearn theme uses the following parameters on top of Hugo ones:\n+++ # Table of contents (toc) is enabled by default. Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = false # If set, this will be used for the page's menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \"\" # If set, this will explicitly override common rules for the expand state of a page's menu entry alwaysopen = true # If set, this will explicitly override common rules for the sorting order of a page's submenu entries ordersectionsby = \"title\" # The title of the page heading will be prefixed by this HTML content headingPre = \"\" # The title of the page heading will be postfixed by this HTML content headingPost = \"\" # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content menuPre = \"\" # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content menuPost = \"\" # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \"\" # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \"\" +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a menuPre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the GitHub icon.\n+++ title = \"GitHub repo\" menuPre = \"\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e \" +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \"My page\" weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, the Relearn theme will use a page’s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page’s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We’ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \"Install on Linux\" menuTitle = \"Linux\" +++ Override expand state rules for menu entries You can change how the theme expands menu entries on the side of the content with the alwaysopen setting on a per page basis. If alwaysopen=false for any given entry, its children will not be shown in the menu as long as it is not necessary for the sake of navigation.\nThe theme generates the menu based on the following rules:\nall parent entries of the active page including their siblings are shown regardless of any settings immediate children entries of the active page are shown regardless of any settings if not overridden, all other first level entries behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=false if not overridden, all other entries of levels besides the first behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=true all visible entries show their immediate children entries if alwaysopen=true; this proceeds recursivley all remaining entries are not shown You can see this feature in action on the example page for children shortcode and its children pages.\n",

While this is a welcome feature, active writers need more: archetypes. These are preconfigured skeleton pages with default frontmatter.\nThe Relearn theme defines some few archetypes of pages but you are free to define new ones to your liking. All can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being the layout of the content.\nPredefined Archetypes Home A Home page is the starting page of your project. It’s best to have only one page of this kind in your project.\nTo create a home page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind home _index.md This leads to a file with the following content\n+++ archetype = \"home\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" +++ Lorem Ipsum. Chapter A Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found below it.\nTo create a chapter page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind chapter \u003cname\u003e/_index.md This leads to a file with the following content\n+++ archetype = \"chapter\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" weight = X +++ Lorem Ipsum. Replace the X with a number. Because this number will be used to generate the subtitle of the chapter page, set the number to a consecutive value starting at 1 for each new chapter level.\nDefault A Default page is any other content page. If you set an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, this archetype will be used to generate the page.\nTo create a default page, run either one of the following commands\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e/_index.md or\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e.md This leads to a file with the following content\n+++ title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" weight = X +++ Lorem Ipsum. Replace the X with a number or delete the whole weight parameter entirly.\nSelfdefined Archetypes If you are in need of further archetypes you can define your own or even redefine existing ones.\nTemplate Define a template file in your project at archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.md and make sure it has at least the frontmatter parameter for that archetype like\n+++ archetype = \"\u003ckind\u003e\" +++ Afterwards you can generate new content files of that kind with the follwing command\nhugo new --kind \u003ckind\u003e \u003cname\u003e/_index.md Partials To define how your archetypes are rendered, define corresponding partial files in your projects directory layouts/partials/archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.\nIf you use an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, the default archetype will be used to generate the page.\nRelated to each archetype, several hook partial files can be given. If a partial for a specific hook is missing, no output is generated for this hook.\nThe following hooks are used:\nName Notes styleclass Defines a set of CSS classes to be added to the HTML’s \u003cmain\u003e element. You can use these classes to define own CSS rules in your custom-header.html article Defines the HTML how to render your content Take a look at the existing archetypes of this theme to get an idea how to utilize it.\n",

The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. John Gruber\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nInfo Bookmark this page and the official Commonmark reference for easy future reference!\nHeadings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u003ch1\u003eh1 Heading\u003c/h1\u003e \u003ch2\u003eh2 Heading\u003c/h2\u003e \u003ch3\u003eh3 Heading\u003c/h3\u003e \u003ch4\u003eh4 Heading\u003c/h4\u003e \u003ch5\u003eh5 Heading\u003c/h5\u003e \u003ch6\u003eh6 Heading\u003c/h6\u003e Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u003c!-- This is a comment --\u003e Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u003chr\u003e element is for creating a “thematic break” between paragraph-level elements.

To activate it, usually you simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code “fence”, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML.\nSee Code Highlighting for additional documentation.\nFor example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:\n```js grunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: 'docs/assets', data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}', helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js', partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}'] }, pages: { options: { layout: 'default.hbs' }, files: { './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs'] } } } }; ``` Renders to:\ngrunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: 'docs/assets', data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}', helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js', partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}'] }, pages: { options: { layout: 'default.hbs' }, files: { './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs'] } } } }; Tables Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

Links Basic link [Assemble](http://assemble.io) Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):\nAssemble\nHTML:\n\u003ca href=\"http://assemble.io\"\u003eAssemble\u003c/a\u003e Add a tooltip [Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \"Visit Upstage!\") Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):\nUpstage\nHTML:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/upstage/\" title=\"Visit Upstage!\"\u003eUpstage\u003c/a\u003e Named Anchors Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u003ca id=\"chapter-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u003ca id=\"chapter-2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u003ca id=\"chapter-3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \"The Stormtroopocat\") Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \"The Dojocat\" Further image formatting The Hugo Markdown parser supports additional non-standard functionality.\nResizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.

See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5226.\nActivate search If not already present, add the follow lines in the same config.toml file.\n[outputs] home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"JSON\"] Relearn theme uses the last improvement available in hugo version 20+ to generate a json index file ready to be consumed by lunr.js javascript search engine.\nHugo generate lunrjs index.json at the root of public folder. When you build the site with hugo server, hugo generates it internally and of course it doesn’t show up in the filesystem\nActivate print support You can activate print support to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site. Just add the PRINT output format to your home, section and page in your config.toml as seen below:\n[outputs] home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"PRINT\", \"JSON\"] section = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"PRINT\"] page = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"PRINT\"] This will add a little printer icon in the top bar. It will switch the page to print preview when clicked. You can then send this page to the printer by using your browser’s usual print functionality.\nNote While colors of your chosen color variant are reset to the theme’s light standard values for printing, this does not apply for Mermaid diagrams and Swagger/OpenAPI Specification. Those will still use the colors of your chosen color variant which may cause a non coherent look on paper.\nMathJax The MathJax configuration parameters can also be set on a specific page. In this case, the global parameter would be overwritten by the local one. See Math for additional documentation.\nExample MathJax is globally disabled. By default it won’t be loaded by any page.\nOn page “Physics” you coded some JavaScript for a dynamic formulae. You can set the MathJax parameters locally to load mathJax on this page.\nYou also can disable MathJax for specific pages while globally enabled.\nMermaid The Mermaid configuration parameters can also be set on a specific page. In this case, the global parameter would be overwritten by the local one. See Mermaid for additional documentation.\nExample Mermaid is globally disabled. By default it won’t be loaded by any page.\nOn page “Architecture” you coded some JavaScript to dynamically generate a class diagram. You can set the Mermaid parameters locally to load mermaid on this page.\nYou also can disable Mermaid for specific pages while globally enabled.\nHome Button Configuration If the disableLandingPageButton option is set to false, a Home button will appear on the left menu. It is an alternative for clicking on the logo. To edit the appearance, you will have to configure two parameters for the defined languages:\n[Languages] [Languages.en] ... landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" ... [Languages.pir] ... landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Arrr! Homme\" ... If those params are not configured for a specific language, they will get their default values:\nlandingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" The home button is going to look like this:\n",

This can be overridden if you wan’t to display page’s meta data above or below the content. content-footer: footer below the content, has a default implementation but you can overwrite it if you don’t like it. Change the logo Create a new file in layouts/partials/ named logo.html. Then write any HTML you want. You could use an img HTML tag and reference an image created under the static folder, or you could paste a SVG definition!\nNote The size of the logo will adapt automatically\nChange the favicon If your favicon is a SVG, PNG or ICO, just drop off your image in your local static/images/ folder and name it favicon.svg, favicon.png or favicon.ico respectivly.\nIf no favicon file is found, the theme will lookup the alternative filename logo in the same location and will repeat the search for the list of supported file types.\nIf you need to change this default behavior, create a new file in layouts/partials/ named favicon.html. Then write something like this:\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/images/favicon.bmp\" type=\"image/bmp\" /\u003e Change the colors The Relearn theme lets you choose between some predefined color variants in light or dark mode, but feel free to add one yourself!\nYou can preview the shipped variants by changing them in the variant selector at the bottom of the menu.\nSingle variant Set the themeVariant value with the name of your theme file. That’s it!\n[params] themeVariant = \"relearn-light\" In the above exaple your theme file has to be named theme-relearn-light.css\nMultiple variants You can also set multiple variants. In this case, the first variant is the default choosen on first view and a variant switch will be shown in the menu footer.\n[params] # Change default color scheme with a variant one. themeVariant = [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] Tip If you want to switch the syntax highlightning theme together with your color variant, generate a syntax highlighting stylesheet and configure your installation according to Hugo’s documentation, and @import this stylesheet in your color variant stylesheet. For an example, take a look into theme-relearn-light.css and config.toml of the exampleSite.\nRoll your own If you are not happy with the shipped variants you can either copy one of the shipped files, edit them in a text editor and configure the themeVariant parameter in your config.toml or just use the interactive variant generator.\n",

Feel free to contribute! Automatic menu generation from multilingual content In-browser language switching Basic configuration After learning how Hugo handle multilingual websites, define your languages in your config.toml file.\nFor example with current English and Piratized English website.\n# English is the default language defaultContentLanguage = \"en\" [Languages] [Languages.en] title = \"Hugo Relearn Theme\" weight = 1 languageName = \"English\" [Languages.pir] title = \"Cap'n Hugo Relearrrn Theme\" weight = 2 languageName = \"Arrr! Pirrrates\" Then, for each new page, append the id of the language to the file.\nSingle file my-page.md is split in two files: in English: my-page.md in Piratized English: my-page.pir.md Single file _index.md is split in two files: in English: _index.md in Piratized English: _index.pir.md Info Be aware that only translated pages are displayed in menu. It’s not replaced with default language content.\nTip Use slug frontmatter parameter to translate urls too.\nSearch In case each page’s content is written in one single language only, the above configuration will already configure the site’s search functionality correctly.\nWarning Although the theme supports a wide variety of supported languages, the site’s search does not. You’ll see error reports in your browsers console log for each unsupported language. Currently unsupported are:\nIndonesian Korean Polish Search with mixed language support In case your page’s content contains text in multiple languages (e.g. you are writing a russian documentation for your english API), you can add those languages to your config.toml to broaden search.\n[params] additionalContentLanguage = [ \"en\" ] As this is an array, you can add multiple additional languages.\nNote Keep in mind that the language code required here, is the base language code. E.g. if you have additonal content in zh-CN, you have to add just zh to this parameter.\nOverwrite translation strings Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (Edit button, Search placeholder and so on). Translations are available in English and Piratized English but you may use another language or want to override default values.\nTo override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder i18n/\u003cidlanguage\u003e.toml and inspire yourself from the theme themes/hugo-theme-relearn/i18n/en.toml\nDisable language switching Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.\nJust set disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true in your config.toml\n[params] # When using mulitlingual website, disable the switch language button. disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true ",
