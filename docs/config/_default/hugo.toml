# change this to a value appropriate for you; if your site is served from a subdirectory
# set it like 'https://example.com/mysite/'

# required to be set to `true` to serve this page from a webserver AND the file system;
# if you set this value to `true`, `baseURL` must not contain a subdirectory;
# if you don't want to serve your page from the file system, you can also set this value
# to `false`
relativeURLs = true # true -> rewrite all site-relative URLs (those with a leading slash) to be relative to the current content

# if you set uglyURLs to `false`, this theme will append 'index.html' to any page bundle link
# so your site can be also served from the file system; if you don't want that,
# set `disableExplicitIndexURLs=true` in the [params] section,
# if st to `true`, adjusting the link is not necessary, so `disableExplicitIndexURLs` has
# no effect
uglyURLs = false    # true -> basic/index.html -> basic.html
