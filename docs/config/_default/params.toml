# Branding
# These options set your overall visual appearance.

# The title to be used for links to the main page
# Default: not set
# This name will be used for the link to the main page in the upper section
# of the menu. If not set, `title` from the Hugo settings will be used.
linkTitle = 'Relearn'

# Used color variants.
# Default: 'auto'
# This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
# from. You can
# - set a single value eg. 'zen-light'
# - an array like [ 'neon', 'learn' ]
# - an array with options like [ { identifier = 'neon' },{ identifier = 'learn' } ]
# The last form allows to set further options for each variant.
# The `identifier` is mandatory. You can also set `name` which overrides the
# value displayed in the variant selector.
# If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
# is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
# default variant, used for first time visitors.
# The theme ships with the following variants: 'relearn-bright',
# 'relearn-light', 'relearn-dark', 'zen-light', 'zen-dark', 'neon', 'learn',
# 'blue', 'green', 'red'. In addition you can use auto mode variants. See the
# docs for a detailed explanation.
# You can also define your own variants. See the docs how this works. Also,
# the docs provide an interactive theme generator to help you with this task.

# off in certain circumstances. For example if you have Hugo's dev server
# running. Also some proxies dislike this optimization.

# Avoid generator meta tags.
# Default: false
# Set this to true if you want to disable generation for generator meta tags
# of Hugo and the theme in your HTML head. In this case also don't forget to
# set Hugo's disableHugoGeneratorInject=true. Otherwise Hugo will generate a
# meta tag into your home page anyways.
disableGeneratorVersion = false

# Avoid unique IDs.
# Default: false

# in HTML fragment links. This can be undesirable for example when testing
# the output for changes. If you disable the random id generation, the theme
# may not function correctly anymore.
disableRandomIds = false

# Conditionally ignore errorlevel settings
# Default: []
# The theme supports checking referenced address (e.g. with
# link.errorlevel, image.errorlevel, etc. see below). Sometimes checks lead
# to console output due to false negatives. You can turn off the checks
# for individual referenced addresses by defining regular expressions here.
# The referenced address will be checked against all regexes of this array.
# If it matches at least one, no output will be written to the console.
# This array can be expanded in the page's frontmatter.

# Additional code dependencies.
# Default: See hugo.toml of the theme
# The theme provides a mechanism to load further JavaScript and CSS
# dependencies on demand only if they are needed. This comes in handy if you

# See the docs how this works.

# The URL prefix to edit a page.
# Default: not set
# If set, an edit button will be shown in the topbar. If the button is hidden,
# also the keyboard shortcuts are disabled. The value can contain the macro
# `${FilePath}` which will be replaced by the file path of your displayed page.
# If no `${FilePath}` is given in the value, the value is treated as if the

# Search
# These options modify various aspects of the search functionality.

# This will also cause the keyboard shortcut to be disabled.

# URL. You also need to set this option if your page already has a content
# page named `search`.
searchPageURL = 'search'

# Multilanguage content.
# Default: not set
# If the search index is enabled and your pages contain further languages
# besides the main one used, add all those auxiliary languages here. This

# Hide heading above the shortcuts menu.
# Default: false

# Define your own sidebar menus.
# Menus are written from the sidebar's top to buttom in the order given in
# these arrays.
# This can be overridden in the page's frontmatter.
# Each entry can contain the following keys:
# - `type` is mandatory. Either `page` in case it should generate a tree from
#    the page structure, `menu` in case it should generate a tree from a
#    defined menu, `custom` for arbitrary HTML snippets or `divider` for a
#    horizontal ruler.
# - `identifier` is mandatory. In case of `type=page`, anything can be used,
#    in case of `type=menu` the `identifier` key must be identical to the
#    key of the menu definition.
# - `main`, boolean. If `true`, the first tree level is spaced more generous
#    and the text is emphasized. Default: `true` for `type=page` and `false`
#    for `type=menu` and `type=custom`
# - `disableTitle`, boolean. If `true`, there is no title above the tree.
#    Default: `true` for `type=page` and `false` for `type=menu`. If a title
#    should be used, in case of `type=page` it will be taken from the page's
#    `menuTitle` front matter and if not set, from the translation files, using
#    the menu `identifier` as key. In case of `type=menu` it will be taken
#    from the menu `title` according to Hugo's documentation and if not set
#    from the menu `name` and if this is not set form the page's `linkTitle`.
# - `pageRef`, optional. In case of `type=page` this is the starting page's
#    path. If not set, the home page will be used.
# - `elements`, optional. In case of `type=custom` the list of elements to
#    display. The theme shipps with the following predefined snippets which
#    all accept the `icon` parameter to overwrite the default icon
#    - languageswitcher: will display the language switcher
#    - variantswitcher: will display the variant switcher
#    - versionswitcher: will display the version switcher
#    - historyclearer: will display a button to clear the history of visited links

# The sidebar header menu.

# Default: ''
# You can control what should happen if a local OpenAPI spec link can not be resolved
# to a resource. If not set, the unresolved link is written as given into the resulting
# output. If set to `warning` the same happens and an additional warning is
# printed. If set to `error` an error message is printed and the build is
# aborted.
# Please note that this can not resolve files inside of your `static` directory.
# This can be overridden in the page's frontmatter.
