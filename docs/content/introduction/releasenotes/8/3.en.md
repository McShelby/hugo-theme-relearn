## 8.3.0 (XXXX-XX-XX) {#8-2-0}

### Hugo 0.141.0

- {{% badge style="hugo" %}}0.141.0{{% /badge %}} This release requires a newer Hugo version.

### New

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme can now [check external links](authoring/frontmatter/linking#check-external-urls) for validity during build. No more stale links anymore.

  To activate it set `urlExternalCheck=true` in the your `hugo.toml` `params` section.

  The name of option `ignoreerror` was changed to `urlIgnoreError` in that matter. You can leave your config unchanged but will see warnings if you are using the deprecated name.
