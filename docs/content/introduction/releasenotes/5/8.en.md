### New

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The new [`icon` shortcode](shortcodes/icon) simplyfies the usage of icons. This can even be combined with also new `badge` shortcode.

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme now supports some of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) syntax and Hugo Markdown extensions, namely [task lists](authoring/markdown#tasks), [defintion lists](authoring/markdown#definitions) and [footnotes](authoring/markdown#footnotes).

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} A new color `--ACCENT-color` was introduced which is used for highlighting search results on the page. In case you simply don't care, you don't need to change anything in your variant stylesheet as the old `yellow` color is still used as default.
