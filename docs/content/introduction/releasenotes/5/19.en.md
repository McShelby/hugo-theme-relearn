## 5.19.0 (2023-08-12) {#5-19-0}

### New

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The [`highlight` shortcode](shortcodes/highlight) now accepts the new parameter `title`. This displays the code like a [single tab](shortcodes/tab). This is also available using Markdown codefences and makes it much easier to write nicer code samples.

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme has added two new color variants `zen-light` and `zen-dark`. Check it out!

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme now [dispatches the custom event](configuration/branding/colors#react-to-variant-switches-in-javascript) `themeVariantLoaded` on the `document` when the variant is fully loaded either initially or by switching the variant manually with the variant selector.

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.3.1. This adds support for the [sankey diagram type](shortcodes/mermaid#sankey) and now comes with full support for YAML inside Mermaid graphs (previously, the theme ignored explicit Mermaid theme settings in YAML).

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} Translation into Hungarian.
