## 2.2.0 (2021-09-09) {#2-2-0}

### New

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} Hidden pages are displayed by default in the sitemap generated by Hugo and are therefore visible for search engine indexing. You can now turn off this behavior by setting `disableSeoHiddenPages=true` in your `hugo.toml`.
