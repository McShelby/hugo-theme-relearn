## 7.4.0 (XXXX-XX-XX) {#7-4-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="note" title=" " %}}Change{{% /badge %}} The `target` parameter of the [`button` shortcode](shortcodes/button#parameter) was deprecated.

  Use [link effects](authoring/markdown#link-effects)  on the `href` parameter instead. You don't need to change anything as the old parameter still works but may generate warnings.

### New

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme now allows page references (given as `pageRef` of a [Hugo menu item](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/), `pageRef` parameter of a [`sidebarmenus` entry ](configuration/sidebar/menus#defining-sidebar-menus) and the `menuPageRef` in a [page's front matter](configuration/sidebar/menus/#displaying-arbitrary-links-in-a-page-menu)) to also be global resources from your `assets` directory.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} If [`link.errorlevel` is configured](authoring/frontmatter/linking/#enabling-link-and-image-link-warnings), now also page references will be checked for existence.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} It is now possible to add query parameter and an optional fragment part to all links. This is regardless whether it is a local or remote address and also applies to Hugo's internal path.

  By that you can now use it on Markdown links and image links, page references and [buttons](shortcodes/button).

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} This release introduces [link effects](authoring/linkeffects) which work similar to [image effects](authoring/imageeffects) and can be set as query parameter on any link.

  With that you currently can specify

  - a link target individually for each link
  - that a link should result in a file download in your browser

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} You can now [configure an ignore list](authoring/frontmatter/linking/#ignoring-false-negatives) of addresses that should be ignored if an errorlevel test fails. This is configured by setting `errorignore=[]` globally in your `hugo.toml` for all errorlevel checks.

  This helps to remove false negatives while still benefitting from the check for all other addresses.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} There are two new [image effects](authoring/imageeffects) that are usable if the linked image points to a resource:

    - **dataurl**: resource is converted to a base64 encoded dataurl
    - **inlinecontent**: in case of SVG resources, the content will be used instead of an `<img>` element, this is useful for applying additional CSS styles to the elements inside of the SVG which is otherwise impossible

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme supports the new [`source` output format](configuration/sitemanagement/outputformats/#source-support) which behaves similar in configuration as the `markdown` output format but allows the original Markdown source including the front matter of a page to be viewed.

  You can see this in action on the above linked page, accessible by clicking the {{% button style="transparent" icon="code" %}}{{% /button %}} topbar button.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} If you haven't overridden `layouts/partials/custom-header.html` and `css/custom.css` and/or `js/custom.js` is present in your project, the theme now adds them to your pages.

  This was done to be compatible with adding custom scripts in an older version of the Hugo documentation.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The logo color is now configurable via the `--MENU-HEADER-color` variable in your variant stylesheets.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} Table headers are sticky now.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The themes documentation has been moved from `exampleSite` to `docs` to make place for a [brand new exampleSite](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/exampleSite/about/index.html).

  This was done because the docs contained to much docs specific configuration and quirks. The new exampleSite is meant as a starting template for your own project with minimal initial configuration.
