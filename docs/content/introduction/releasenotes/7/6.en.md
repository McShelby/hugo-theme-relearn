## 7.6.0 (2025-04-03) {#7-6-0}

### New

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} Information was added to the docs about the kind of [data the theme stores in the readers browser](configuration/sitemanagement/storedinformation).

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The new [`tree` shortcode](shortcodes/tree) displays lists as nicely formatted trees with configurable icon and icon color.

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The [`icon` shortcode](shortcodes/icon) has learned the `style` and `color` options known from other shortcodes.

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme [supports versioning](configuration/sitemanagement/versioning) now, where you can keep older versions of your site accessible via a version switcher at the top of the menu.

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The menu configuration for the main menu area, [introduced in 7.1.0](introduction/releasenotes/7/1), is extended to the non-scrolling menu header area between search box and main scrolling area using the `sidebarheadermenus` option and to the menu footer area using the `sidebarfootermenus` option.

  The [configuration for all sidebar menus](/configuration/sidebar/menus#defining-sidebar-menus) is similar and now comes with two new types of menus.

  The `divider` type adds a horizontal ruler.

  The `custom` type allows to insert any HTML snippets into the menu. The HTML must be wrapped in a `li` element to not break HTML validation. The theme ships with the following snippets:

  - `languageswitcher`: will display the language switcher
  - `variantswitcher`: will display the variant switcher
  - `versionswitcher`: will display the version switcher
  - `historyclearer`: will display a button to clear the history of visited links

  You donâ€™t need to change anything in your existing installation as the old configuration is used as a default.
