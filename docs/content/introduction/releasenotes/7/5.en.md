## 7.5.0 (2025-03-04) {#7-5-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="change" %}}Change{{% /badge %}} All dependencies were moved from `static` to `assets`. Affected are stylesheets, scripts and fonts.

  This is mainly done to reduce the output in `public` to only contain necessary files of your site.

  E.g. if you don't use math anywhere on your site, it is not necessary to output the MathJax library to public.

  The directory structure will be adjusted so all 3rd-party dependencies are stored in their appropriate module sub directory. So what previously was `static/js/js-yaml.js` will become `assets/j/js-yaml/js-yaml.js`.

  Take a look into the [new `assets` directory](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/tree/main/assets). **Only if you have overridden some of these files**, you will have to adjust their paths accordingly. All other additional files should stay where they are.

- {{% badge style="change" %}}Change{{% /badge %}} Buttons for languages written right to left are now rendered correctly, so you will experience visual differences in those cases. This applies to

  - the Mermaid zoom button depending on the page's language
  - inline and block copy-to-clipboard buttons depending of the contained text content
