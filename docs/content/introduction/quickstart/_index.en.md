Here's how to start your new website. If you're new to Hugo, we recommend learning more about it in its excellent [starter's guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

> [!note]
> This quickstart is not meant for a production setup. In production you always want to use specific versions of the theme and Hugo. See the [upgrade page](introduction/upgrade) to learn how to obtain a specific version of the theme.

## Install Hugo

Download and install Hugo {{% badge style="hugo" %}}0.126.3{{% /badge %}} or newer for your operating system [following the instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

The _standard_ edition of Hugo is sufficient but you can also use the _extended_ edition.

## Create your Project

Use Hugo's `new site` command to make a new website

````shell
hugo new site my-new-site
````

Then move into the new directory

````shell
cd my-new-site
````

Run all following commands from this directory.

## Install the Theme

### Download as a Zip File

You can [download the theme as a .zip file](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/archive/main.zip) and unzip it into the `themes/hugo-theme-relearn` directory.

Then add this at the top of your `hugo.toml`

{{< multiconfig file=hugo >}}
theme = 'hugo-theme-relearn'
{{< /multiconfig >}}

### Use Hugo's Module System

Install the Relearn theme using [Hugo's module system](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/#use-a-module-for-a-theme)

````shell
hugo mod init example.com
````

Then add this at the end of your `hugo.toml`

{{< multiconfig file=hugo >}}
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = 'github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn'
{{< /multiconfig >}}

### Use as a Git Submodule

If you're using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for your project, you can create a repository now

````shell
git init
````

Add the theme as a Git submodule

````shell
git submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git themes/hugo-theme-relearn
````

Then add this at the top of your `hugo.toml`

{{< multiconfig file=hugo >}}
theme = 'hugo-theme-relearn'
{{< /multiconfig >}}

## Create Content

### Your Home Page

Start by making a home page

````shell
hugo new --kind home _index.md
````

The new home page file `content/_index.md` has two parts: the page info (like `title`) at the top, called [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/), and the page content below.

### Your First Chapter Page

Chapters are top-level pages that contain other pages. They have a special layout.

Make your first chapter page

````shell
hugo new --kind chapter log/_index.md
````

The new file `content/log/_index.md` has a `weight` number in the front matter. By the themes default settings this sets the chapter's subtitle and its order in the menu.

### Your First Content Pages

Now make content pages inside the chapter. Here are three ways to do this

````shell
hugo new log/first-day/_index.md
hugo new log/second-day/index.md
hugo new log/third-day.md
````

Hugo treats these files differently based on their file names. Learn more in [Hugo's guide](https://gohugo.io/content-management/).

Feel free to edit these files. Change the `title`, add a `weight` if you want, and write your content.

## Test your Website

Start your new website on your computer with this command

````shell
hugo serve
````

Open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in your web browser.

You can keep the server running while you edit. The browser will update automatically when you save changes.

## Build and Deploy

When your site is ready to go live, run this command

````shell
hugo
````

This creates a `public` directory with all your website files.

You can upload this directory to any web server, or use one of [Hugo's many other ways to publish](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/).

## Next Steps

Your site is now fully functional.

You can continue [configuring your site](configuration) to your needs.

Or just start [authoring content](authoring) and discover what's possible.
