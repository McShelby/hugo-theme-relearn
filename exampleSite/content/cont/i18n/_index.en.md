The Relearn theme is fully compatible with Hugo multilingual mode.

It provides:

- Translation strings for default values (English, Arabic, Dutch, Piratized English, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Piratized English, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Turkish). Feel free to contribute!
- Automatic menu generation from multilingual content
- In-browser language switching

![I18n menu](/cont/i18n/images/i18n-menu.gif)

## Basic configuration

After learning [how Hugo handle multilingual websites](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual), define your languages in your `config.toml` file.

For example with current English and Piratized English website.

```toml
# English is the default language
defaultContentLanguage = "en"

[Languages]
[Languages.en]
title = "Documentation for Hugo Relearn Theme"
weight = 1
languageName = "English"

[Languages.pir]
title = "Documentat'n fer Cap'n Hugo Relearrrn Theme"
weight = 2
languageName = "Arrr! Pirrrates"
```

Then, for each new page, append the *id* of the language to the file.

- Single file `my-page.md` is split in two files:
    - in English: `my-page.md`
    - in Piratized English: `my-page.pir.md`
- Single file `_index.md` is split in two files:
    - in English: `_index.md`
    - in Piratized English: `_index.pir.md`

## Overwrite translation strings

Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (*Edit this page* button, *Search placeholder* and so on). Translations are available in English and Piratized English but you may use another language or want to override default values.

To override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder `i18n/<idlanguage>.toml` and inspire yourself from the theme `themes/hugo-theme-relearn/i18n/en.toml`

## Disable language switching

Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.

Just set `disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true` in your `config.toml`

```toml
[params]
  # When using monolingual website, disable the switch language button.
  disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true
```
