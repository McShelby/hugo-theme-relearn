The highest point of our mighty vessel! Up here, the crow's nest scout shouts coordinates to our helmsman below, though sometimes they're just playing an elaborate game of maritime telephone. The crow's nest offers the best views in the house (or ship), perfect for spotting incoming weather, distant lands, or that seagull that keeps stealing the captain's lunch.
