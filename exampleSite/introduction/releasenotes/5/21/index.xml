    <title>Version 5.21 :: Hugo Relearn Theme</title>
    <link>https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/introduction/releasenotes/5/21/index.html</link>
    <description>5.21.0 (2023-09-18) Change Change We made changes to the menu footer to improve alignment with the menu items in most cases. Care was taken not to break your existing overwritten footer. Anyways, if you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may want to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) of your partial. New New This release comes with an awesome new feature, that allows you to customize your topbar buttons, change behavior, reorder them or define entirely new ones, unique to your installation. See the documentation for further details.</description>
