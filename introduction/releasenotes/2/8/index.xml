    <title>Version 2.8 :: Hugo Relearn Theme</title>
    <link>https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/introduction/releasenotes/2/8/index.html</link>
    <description>2.8.0 (2021-11-03) Change Change Although never officially documented, this release removes the font Novacento/Novecento. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with Work Sans. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for Czech. New New The theme now supports favicons served from static/images/ named as favicon or logo in SVG, PNG or ICO format out of the box. An overridden partial layouts/partials/favicon.html may not be necessary anymore in most cases.</description>
