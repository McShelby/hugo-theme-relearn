    <description>5.7.0 (2022-11-29) Change Change The Korean language translation for this theme is now available with the language code ko. Formerly the country code kr was used instead. New New The button shortcode can now also be used as a real button inside of HTML forms - although this is a pretty rare use case. The documentation was updated accordingly.</description>
