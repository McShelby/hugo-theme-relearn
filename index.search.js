The example below uses the GitHub icon.\n​ toml yaml json +++ menuPre = \"\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e \" title = 'GitHub repo' +++ --- menuPre: '\u003ci class=''fab fa-github''\u003e\u003c/i\u003e ' title: GitHub repo --- { \"menuPre\": \"\\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e \", \"title\": \"GitHub repo\" } Ordering Sibling Menu/Page Entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'My page' weight = 5 +++ --- title: My page weight: 5 --- { \"title\": \"My page\", \"weight\": 5 } Using a Custom Title for Menu Entries By default, the Relearn theme will use a page’s title attribute for the menu item.\nBut a page’s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. Hugo adds the linkTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n​ toml yaml json +++ linkTitle = 'Linux' title = 'Install on Linux' +++ --- linkTitle: Linux title: Install on Linux --- { \"linkTitle\": \"Linux\", \"title\": \"Install on Linux\" } Override Expand State Rules for Menu Entries You can change how the theme expands menu entries on the side of the content with the alwaysopen setting on a per page basis. If alwaysopen=false for any given entry, its children will not be shown in the menu as long as it is not necessary for the sake of navigation.\nThe theme generates the menu based on the following rules:\nall parent entries of the active page including their siblings are shown regardless of any settings immediate children entries of the active page are shown regardless of any settings if not overridden, all other first level entries behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=false if not overridden, all other entries of levels besides the first behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=true all visible entries show their immediate children entries if alwaysopen=true; this proceeds recursively all remaining entries are not shown You can see this feature in action on the example page for children shortcode and its children pages.\nDisable Section Pages You may want to structure your pages in a hierarchical way but don’t want to generate pages for those sections? The theme got you covered.\nTo stay with the initial example: Suppose you want level-one appear in the sidebar but don’t want to generate a page for it. So the entry in the sidebar should not be clickable but should show an expander.\nFor this, open content/level-one/_index.md and add the following frontmatter\n​ toml yaml json +++ collapsibleMenu = true [_build] render = 'never' +++ --- _build: render: never collapsibleMenu: true --- { \"_build\": { \"render\": \"never\" }, \"collapsibleMenu\": true } ",

    "content": "This document shows you what’s new in the latest release and flags it with one of the following badges. For a detailed list of changes, see the history page.\n0.121.0 The minimum required Hugo version.\nBreaking A change that requires action by you after upgrading to assure the site is still functional.\nChange A change in default behavior that may requires action by you if you want to revert it.\nNew Marks new behavior you might find interesting or comes configurable.\n6.1.0.beta (XXXX-XX-XX) Change The include shortcode is now able to resolve links to pages as well as resources or files in the file system (the old behavior).\nChange To make the asset buster mechanism more robust, some internally used stylesheets where restructured. This generally should not affect your page in any negative way.\nNew The openapi shortcode is now able to resolve links to resources as well as to files in the file system (the old behavior). You can configure to generate warnings or errors during build by setting openapi.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml if a path can not be resolved.\n6.0.0 (2024-04-27) Breaking This release requires you to move your self-defined variant (theme-*.css) and chroma stylesheets (chroma-*.css) from static/css to assets/css.\nThis was necessary to avoid permission errors on build if running in certain Unix configurations.\nIn addition it is not allowed anymore to @import your chroma stylesheet from inside of your variant stylesheet.\nSay, your chroma stylesheet is named chroma-monokai.css, you have to add the following inside your variant stylesheet:\n--CODE-theme: monokai; Breaking The parameter description in your hugo.toml will now be ignored.\nWith the newly introduced unified handling of descriptions throughout the theme, the only place the old parameter would have been used was your home page.\nFor migration, move the description parameter of your hugo.toml into the frontmatter section of your home page.\nBreaking Search support for the json outputformat deprecated in 5.4.0 was removed.\nChange it to search for the homepage in your hugo.toml. See the docs for detailed configuration.\nBreaking The frontmatter option menuTitle deprecated in 5.24.0 was removed in favor for Hugo’s own linkTitle.\nAdditionally, if set, linkTitle will now be used instead of title to generate the breadcrumb.\nBreaking The swagger shortcode deprecated in 5.13.0 was removed in favor for the openapi shortcode with the same set of parameter.\nBreaking Support for Internet Explorer 11 was finally dropped.\nChange With the removal of support for Internet Explorer 11, Font Awesome was upgraded to version 6.5.2.\nYou may experience slight changes for some icons. In addition you have additional ~1700 icons to chose from.\nChange The children shortcode was fixed to adhere to its documentation, generating the description based on this rule: When no description or summary exists for the page, the first 70 words of the content is taken.\nPreviously, the summary erroneously was ignored which now can lead to different output if you set description=true as a parameter.\nNew The include shortcode is now able to resolve links to resources as well as to files in the file system (the old behavior). You can configure to generate warnings or errors during build by setting include.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml if a path can not be resolved.\nNew Math is now usable without enclosing it in a shortcode or codefence by using Hugo’s passthrough configuration.\nNew Translation into Romanian.\n5.27.0 (2024-04-07) 0.121.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange If the theme is configured to generate warnings or errors during build by setting image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml, it will now also generate output if a link fragment is not found in the target page.\nChange The dependency loader was made more versatile.\nThe configuration in your hugo.toml does not require the location parameter anymore. If you still use it, the theme will work as before but will generate a warning. So you don’t need to change anything, yet.\nWith the new mechanism, your dependency loader now receives an additional location parameter instead that you can query to inject your dependencies in the desired location.\nBy that you can now call the dependency mechanism in your own overriden partials by giving it a distinct location parameter. In addition your injected files can now be spread to multiple locations which wasn’t previously possible.\nNew Additional styling was added for the native HTML elements \u003cmark\u003e and \u003ckbd\u003e. To use them you must allow the usage of HTML in your hugo.toml. The Markdown documentation was enhanced for this.\nNew You now can scroll forward and backward through all headings of a page by using ALT 🡑 and ALT 🡓. This also works for the PRINT output format.\nNew The breadcrumbs used in the topbar, search results and the taxonomy term lists are now using the pages frontmatter linktitle instead of title if set.\n5.26.0 (2024-03-18) New The lazy loading of images is now configurable by using the new lazy image effect. The default value hasn’t changed in comparison to older versions, you don’t need to change anything.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the max width of the main area, eg. in case you want to use the full page width for your content.\nNew Images and Codefences are now respecting Hugo’s Markdown attributes.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for block diagrams.\nNew This release fixes a long outstanding bug where the page wasn’t repositioning correctly when going forward or backward in your browser history.\n5.25.0 (2024-02-29) Change This release deprecates the attachments shortcode in favor of the new the resources shortcode.\nIf you are using Hugo below 0.123.0, you don’t need to change anything as the old shortcode still works (but may generate warnings).\nAnyways, users are strongly advised to migrate as the attachments shortcode will not receive support anymore. Migration instructions are listed on the attachments shortcode page.\nChange If you run Hugo with GitInfo configured, the default page footer now prints out name, email address and date of the last commit. If you want to turn this off you either have to run Hugo without GitInfo (which is the default) or overwrite the content-footer.html partial.\n5.24.0 (2024-02-28) 0.112.4 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange The topbar button received a way to add text next to the icon. For this, the original title option was renamed to hint while the new title option is now displayed next to the icon.\nChange The frontmatter option menuTitle is now deprecated in favor for Hugo’s own linkTitle. You don’t need to change anything as the old menuTitle option is still supported.\nChange The light themes have a bit more contrast for content text and headings. Also the syntaxhighlighting was changed to the more colorful MonokaiLight. This brings the syntaxhighlighting in sync with the corresponding dark theme variants, which are using Monokai. If you dislike this, you can create your own color variant file as described here.\nNew If the theme can not resolve a link to a page or image, you can now generate warnings or errors during build by setting link.errorlevel or image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml respectively. By default this condition is silently ignored and the link is written as-is.\nPlease note that a page link will generate false negatives if uglyURLs=true and it references an ordinary page before 0.123.0.\nPlease note that an image link will generate false negatives if the file resides in your static directory.\nNew You now can configure additional options for every theme variant in your hugo.toml. This allows for optional advanced functionality. You don’t need to change anything as the old configuration options will still work (but may generate warnings now).\nThe advanced functionality allows you to set an explicit name for a theme variant and now allows for multiple auto mode variants that adjust to the light/dark preference of your OS settings.\nNew New partial for defining the heading. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Support for Hugo’s built-in figure shortcode.\nNew On taxonomy and term pages you can now use prev/next navigation as within the normal page structure.\nNew In additiion to the existing menu width customization, it is now also possible to set the width of the menu flyout for small screen sizes with the --MENU-WIDTH-S CSS property.\nNew Improvements for accessibility when tabbing through the page for images, links and tab handles.\nNew The editURL config parameter is now overwritable in your pages frontmatter. In addition it received more versatility by letting you control where to put the file path into the URL. This is achieved by replacing the variable ${FilePath} in your URL by the pages file path. You don’t need to change anything in your existing configuration as the old way without the replacement variable still works.\nNew The themes config and frontmatter options received a comprehensive documentation update. In addition the theme switched from config.toml to hugo.toml.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.121.0 or higher for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.123.0 or higher for theme specific output formats and handling of taxonomy and term titles. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\n5.23.0 (2023-11-03) Change With 0.120.0 the author settings move into the [params] array in your hugo.toml. Because this collides with the previous way, the theme expected author information, it now adheres to Hugo standards and prints out a warning during built if something is wrong.\nChange your previous setting from\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] author = 'Hugo' params: author: Hugo { \"params\": { \"author\": \"Hugo\" } } to\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] [params.author] name = 'Hugo' params: author: name: Hugo { \"params\": { \"author\": { \"name\": \"Hugo\" } } } Change Taxonomy term pages now add the breadcrumb for each listed page. If this gets too crowded for you, you can turn the breadcrumbs off in your hugo.toml by adding disableTermBreadcrumbs=true.\nNew Taxonomy and term pages are now allowed to contain content. This is added inbetween the title and the page list.\nNew It is now possible to print custom taxonomies anywhere in your page. See the docs.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the menu width for your whole site. See the docs.\nNew This release adds social media meta tags for the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Cards to your site. See the docs.\nNew This release comes with additional sort options for the menu and the children shortcode. Both will now accept the following values: weight, title, linktitle, modifieddate, expirydate, publishdate, date, length or default (adhering to Hugo’s default sort order).\nNew The theme now provides a mechanism to load further JavaScript dependencies defined by you only if it is needed. This comes in handy if you want to add own shortcodes that depend on additional JavaScript code to be loaded. See the docs.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for the xychart type.\nNew This release adds portable Markdown links.\nPreviously it was not possible to use pure Markdown links in a configuration independent way to link to pages inside of your project. It always required you to know how your uglyURLs setting is, wheather you link to a page or page bundle and in case of relative links if your current page is a page or page bundle. (eg. [generator](generator/index.html) vs. [generator](generator.html)). This is a hassle as you have to change these links manually once you change your uglyURLs setting or change the type of a page.\nYou could work around this by using the relref shortcode (eg [generator]({{% relref \"../generator\" %}})) which works but results in non-portable Markdown.\nNow it’s possible to use the same path of a call to relref in a plain Markdown link (eg [generator](../generator)). This is independent of any configuration settings or the page types involved in linking. Note, that this requires your links to be given without any extension, so [generator](generator/index.html) will work as before.\nThe following types of linking are supported:\nlink description [generator](en/basics/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](/en/basics/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](basics/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](/basics/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](./../generator) relative from the current page [generator](../generator) relative from the current page 5.22.0 (2023-10-02) Change This release fixes an issue where in unfortunate conditions DOM ids generated by Hugo may collide with DOM ids set by the theme. To avoid this, all theme DOM ids are now prefixed with R-.\nIf you haven’t modified anything, everything is fine. Otherwise you have to check your custom CSS rules and JavaScript code.\nChange You can now have structural sections in the hierarchical menu without generating a page for it.\nThis can come in handy, if content for such a section page doesn’t make much sense to you. See the documentation for how to do this.\nThis feature may require you to make changes to your existing installation if you are already using shortcuts to pages inside of your project with a headless branch parent.\nIn this case it is advised to remove the title from the headless branch parent’s frontmatter, as it will otherwise appear in your breadcrumbs.\nNew It is now possible to overwrite the setting for collapsibleMenu of your hugo.toml inside of a page’s frontmatter.\nNew If a Mermaid graph is zoomable a button to reset the view is now added to the upper right corner. The button is only shown once the mouse is moved over the graph.\nNew It is now possible to remove the root breadcrumb by setting disableRootBreadcrumb=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew The output of the dedicated search page now displays the result’s breadcrumb.\nNew Table rows now change their background color on every even row.\nNew Translation into Swahili. This language is not supported for search.\n5.21.0 (2023-09-18) Change We made changes to the menu footer to improve alignment with the menu items in most cases. Care was taken not to break your existing overwritten footer. Anyways, if you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may want to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) of your partial.\nNew This release comes with an awesome new feature, that allows you to customize your topbar buttons, change behavior, reorder them or define entirely new ones, unique to your installation. See the documentation for further details.\nNew The theme has updated its Swagger dependency to 5.7.2 for the openapi shortcode. This brings support for OpenAPI Specification 3.1.\n5.20.0 (2023-08-26) Change The theme has updated its Swagger dependency to 5.4.1 for the openapi shortcode.\nWith this comes a change in the light theme variants of Relearn Bright, Relearn Light and Zen Light by switching the syntaxhighlighting inside of openapi to a light scheme. This brings it more in sync with the code style used by the theme variants itself.\nAdditionally, the syntaxhighlighting inside of openapi for printing was switched to a light scheme for all theme variants.\nIf you dislike this change, you can revert this in your theme variants CSS by adding\n--OPENAPI-CODE-theme: obsidian; --PRINT-OPENAPI-CODE-theme: obsidian; Change For consistency reasons, we renamed the CSS variable --MENU-SECTION-HR-color to --MENU-SECTION-SEPARATOR-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew The theme variants Zen Light and Zen Dark now add more contrast between menu, topbar and content by adding thin borders.\nThose borders are now configurable by using the CSS variables --MAIN-TOPBAR-BORDER-color, --MENU-BORDER-color, --MENU-TOPBAR-BORDER-color, --MENU-TOPBAR-SEPARATOR-color, --MENU-HEADER-SEPARATOR-color and --MENU-SECTION-ACTIVE-CATEGORY-BORDER-color.\nFor existing variants nothing has changed visually.\nNew The default values for the image effects are now configurable for your whole site via hugo.toml or for each page through frontmatter.\nNew This release fixes a long outstanding bug where Mermaid graphs could not be displayed if they were initially hidden - like in collapsed expand or inactive tabs.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions lower than 0.111.0 for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\n5.19.0 (2023-08-12) New The highlight shortcode now accepts the new parameter title. This displays the code like a single tab. This is also available using codefences and makes it much easier to write nicer code samples.\nNew The theme has added two new color variants zen-light and zen-dark. Check it out!\nNew The theme now dispatches the custom event themeVariantLoaded on the document when the variant is fully loaded either initially or by switching the variant manually with the variant selector.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.3.1. This adds support for the sankey diagram type and now comes with full support for YAML inside Mermaid graphs (previously, the theme ignored explicit Mermaid theme settings in YAML).\nNew Translation into Hungarian.\n5.18.0 (2023-07-27) Change The theme adds additional warnings for deprecated or now unsupported features.\nChange There are visual improvements in displaying text links in your content as well as to some other clickable areas in the theme. If you’ve overwritten some theme styles in your own CSS, keep this in mind.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.95.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew The siteparam shortcode is now capable in displaying nested params as well as supporting text formatting.\n5.17.0 (2023-06-22) Change The default behavior for the copy-to-clipboard feature for code blocks has changed.\nThe copy-to-clipboard button for code blocks will now only be displayed if the reader hovers the code block.\nIf you dislike this new behavior you can turn it off and revert to the old behavior by adding [params] disableHoverBlockCopyToClipBoard=true to your hugo.toml.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.114.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew The new highlight shortcode replaces Hugo’s default implementation and is fully compatible. So you don’t need to change anything.\nIn addition it offers some extensions. Currently only the wrap extension option is provided to control whether a code block should be wrapped or scrolled if to long to fit.\n5.16.0 (2023-06-10) Change The theme now provides warnings for deprecated or now unsupported features. The warnings include hints how to fix them and an additional link to the documentation.\nDEPRECATION warnings mark features that still work but may be removed in the future.\nUNSUPPORTED warnings mark features that will not work anymore.\nChange The 404 error page was revamped. Hopefully you will not see this very often.\nNew The tabs shortcode and the tab shortcode received some love and now align with their style, color, title and icon parameter to the other shortcodes.\nThe visuals are now slightly different compared to previous versions. Most noteable, if you now display a single code block in a tab, its default styling will adapt to that of a code block but with a tab handle at the top.\nAdditionally the name parameter was renamed to title but you don’t need to change anything yet as the old name will be used as a fallback. Nevertheless you will get deprecation warnings while executing Hugo.\nNew The theme now optionally supports separate favicons for light \u0026 dark mode.\n5.15.0 (2023-05-29) Change Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.112.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nThe attachments shortcode has compatibility issues with newer Hugo versions. You must switch to leaf bundles or are locked to Hugo \u003c 0.112.0 for now.\nIt is planned to refactor the attchments shortcode in the future. This will make it possible to use the shortcode in branch bundles again but not in simple pages anymore. This will most likely come with a breaking change.\nChange The tabs shortcode has changed behavior if you haven’t set the groupid parameter.\nFormerly all tab views without a groupid were treated as so they belong to the same group. Now, each tab view is treated as it was given a unique id.\nNew The already known tabshas a new friend the tab shortcode to make it easier to create a tab view in case you only need one single tab. Really handy if you want to flag your code examples with a language identifier.\nAdditionally for such a use case, the whitespace between a tab outline and the code is removed if only a single code block is contained.\nNew Besides the tag taxonomy the theme now also provides the category taxonomy out of the box and shows them in the content footer of each page.\n5.14.0 (2023-05-20) New The taxonomy pages received some love in this release, making them better leverage available screen space and adding translation support for the taxonomy names.\nHugo’s default taxonmies tags and categories are already contained in the theme’s i18n files. If you have self-defined taxonomies, you can add translations by adding them to your own i18n files. If you don’t provide translations, the singualar and plural forms are taken as configured in your hugo.toml.\nNew To give you more flexibility in customizing your article layout a new partial content-header.html is introduced.\nThis came out of the requirement to customize the position of article tags, which by default are displayed above the title. A second requirement was to also show additional taxonomies not supported by the theme natively. While Hugo supports tags and categories by default, the theme only displays tags.\nSo how to adjust the position of tags starting from the theme’s default where tags are only shown above the title?\nHide tags above title: Overwrite content-header.html with an empty file. Show tags between title and content: Overwrite heading-post.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. Show tags below content: Overwrite content-footer.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. New The new parameter breadcrumbSeparator is now available in your hugo.toml to change the - well - separator of the breadcrumb items. An appropriate default is in place if you do not configure anything.\n5.13.0 (2023-05-17) Change The swagger shortcode was deprecated in favor for the openapi shortcode. You don’t need to change anything yet as the old name will be used as a fallback. It is planned to remove the swagger shortcode in the next major release.\nAdditionally, the implemantion of this shortcode was switched from RapiDoc to SwaggerUI.\n5.12.0 (2023-05-04) Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed (again). While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew Support for the great VSCode Front Matter extension which provides on-premise CMS capabilties to Hugo.\nThe theme provides Front Matter snippets for its shortcodes. Currently only English and German is supported. Put a reference into your frontmatter.json like this\n​ frontmatter.json { ... \"frontMatter.extends\": [ \"./vscode-frontmatter/snippets.en.json\" ] ... } New Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic) is now complete and extended to the menu, the top navigation bar and print. You can experience this in the pirate translation. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew The scrollbars are now colored according to their variant color scheme to better fit into the visuals.\n5.11.0 (2023-02-07) Change The theme removed the popular jQuery library from its distribution.\nIn case you made changes to the theme that are depending on this library you can place a copy of jQuery into your static/js directory and load it from your own layouts/partials/custom-header.html like this:\n​ layouts/partials/custom-header.html \u003cscript src=\"{{\"js/jquery.min.js\"| relURL}}\" defer\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change Mermaid diagrams can now be configured for pan and zoom on site-, page-level or individually for each graph.\nThe default setting of on, in effect since 1.1.0, changed back to off as there was interference with scrolling on mobile and big pages.\nChange The theme is now capable to visually adapt to your OS’s light/dark mode setting.\nThis is also the new default setting if you haven’t configured themeVariant in your hugo.toml.\nAdditionally you can configure the variants to be taken for light/dark mode with the new themeVariantAuto parameter.\nThis is not supported for Internet Explorer 11, which still displays in the relearn-light variant.\nChange The JavaScript code for handling image lightboxes (provided by Featherlight) was replaced by a CSS-only solution.\nThis also changed the lightbox effects parameter from featherlight=false to lightbox=false. Nevertheless you don’t need to change anything as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the expand shortcode was changed. While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew Translation into Czech. This language is not supported for search.\nNew GitHub releases are also now tagged for the main version (eg. 1.2.x), major version (eg. 1.x) and the latest (just x) release making it easier for you to pin the theme to a certain version.\n5.10.0 (2023-01-25) New The attachments, badge, button and notice shortcodes have a new parameter color to set arbitrary CSS color values.\nAdditionally the --ACCENT-color brand color introduced in version 5.8.0 is now supported with these shortcodes.\n5.9.0 (2022-12-23) Breaking With this version it is now possible to not only have sections on the first menu level but also pages.\nIt was later discovered, that this causes pages only meant to be displayed in the More section of the menu and stored directly inside your content directory to now show up in the menu as well.\nTo get rid of this undesired behavior you have two choices:\nMake the page file a headless branch bundle (contained in its own subdirectory and called _index.md) and add the following frontmatter configuration to the file (see exampleSite’s content/showcase/_index.en.md). This causes its content to not be ontained in the sitemap.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'Showcase' [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = true render = 'always' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: true render: always title: Showcase --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": true, \"render\": \"always\" }, \"title\": \"Showcase\" } Store the page file for below a parent headless branch bundle and add the following frontmatter to he parent (see exampleSite’s content/more/_index.en.md). Don’t give this page a title as this will cause it to be shown in the breadcrumbs - a thing you most likely don’t want.\n​ toml yaml json +++ [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = false render = 'never' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: false render: never --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": false, \"render\": \"never\" } } In this case, the file itself can be a branch bundle, leaf bundle or simple page (see exampleSite’s content/more/credits.en.md). This causes its content to be contained in the sitemap.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'Credits' +++ --- title: Credits --- { \"title\": \"Credits\" } Change The required folder name for the attachments shortcode was changed for leaf bundles.\nPreviously, the attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups were required to be in a files subdirectory. For page bundles and leaf bundles in multilang setups they were always required to be in a _index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files or index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files subdirectory accordingly.\nThis added unnecessary complexity. So attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups can now also reside in a index.files directory. Although the old files directory is now deprecated, if both directories are present, only the old files directory will be used for compatibility.\nChange Absolute links prefixed with http:// or https:// are now opened in a separate browser tab.\nYou can revert back to the old behavior by defining externalLinkTarget=\"_self\" in the params section of your hugo.toml.\nNew The theme now supports Hugo’s module system.\n5.8.0 (2022-12-08) New The new badge shortcode is now available to add highly configurable markers to your content as you can see it on this page.\nNew The new icon shortcode simplyfies the usage of icons. This can even be combined with also new badge shortcode.\nNew The theme now supports some of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) syntax and Hugo Markdown extensions, namely task lists, defintion lists and footnotes.\nNew A new color --ACCENT-color was introduced which is used for highlighting search results on the page. In case you simply don’t care, you don’t need to change anything in your variant stylesheet as the old yellow color is still used as default.\n5.7.0 (2022-11-29) Change The Korean language translation for this theme is now available with the language code ko. Formerly the country code kr was used instead.\nNew The button shortcode can now also be used as a real button inside of HTML forms - although this is a pretty rare use case. The documentation was updated accordingly.\nNew The search now supports the Korean language.\n5.6.0 (2022-11-18) New This release introduces an additional dedicated search page. On this page, displayed search results have more space making it easier scanning through large number of results.\nTo activate this feature, you need to configure it in your hugo.toml as a new outputformat searchpage for the home page. If you don’t configure it, no dedicated search page will be accessible and the theme works as before.\nYou can access the search page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or pressing enter inside of the search box.\nNew Keyboard handling for the TOC and search was improved.\nPressing CTRL+ALT+t now will not only toggle the TOC overlay but also places the focus to the first heading on opening. Subsequently this makes it possible to easily select headings by using the TAB key.\nThe search received its own brand new keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+f. This will focus the cursor inside of the search box so you can immediately start your search by typing.\nNew You are now able to turn off the generation of generator meta tags in your HTML head to hide the used versions of Hugo and this theme.\nTo configure this in your hugo.toml make sure to set Hugo’s disableHugoGeneratorInject=true and also [params] disableGeneratorVersion=true, otherwise Hugo will generate a meta tag into your home page automagically.\nNew Creation of your project gets a little bit faster with this release.\nThis addresses increased build time with the 5.x releases. The theme now heavily caches partial results leading to improved performance. To further increase performance, unnecessary parts of the page are now skipped for creation of the print output (eg. menus, navigation bar, etc.).\n5.5.0 (2022-11-06) Change The way images are processed has changed. Now images are lazy loaded by default which speeds up page load on slow networks and/or big pages and also the print preview.\nFor that the JavaScript code to handle the lightbox and image effects on the client side was removed in favour for static generation of those effects on the server.\nIf you have used HTML directly in your Markdown files, this now has the downside that it doesn’t respect the effect query parameter anymore. In this case you have to migrate all your HTML img URLs manually to the respective HTML attributes.\nOld New \u003cimg src=\"pic.png?width=20vw\u0026classes=shadow,border\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"pic.png\" style=\"width:20vw;\" class=\"shadow border\"\u003e 5.4.0 (2022-11-01) Change With the proper settings in your hugo.toml your page is now servable from the local file system using file:// URLs.\nPlease note that the searchbox will only work for this if you reconfigure your outputformat for the homepage in your hugo.toml from json to search. The now deprecated json outputformat still works as before, so there is no need to reconfigure your installation if it is only served from http:// or https://.\nChange The button shortcode has a new parameter target to set the destination frame/window for the URL to open. If not given, it defaults to a new window/tab for external URLs or is not set at all for internal URLs. Previously even internal URLs where opened in a new window/tab.\nNew The math shortcode and mermaid shortcode now also support the align parameter if codefence syntax is used.\nNew Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic). This is only implemented for the content area but not the navigation sidebar. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew Translation into Finnish (Suomi).\n5.3.0 (2022-10-07) Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed. The functionality of the new implementation does not work with old browsers (Internet Explorer 11).\nNew Image formatting has two new classes to align images to the left or right. Additionally, the already existing inline option is now documented.\nNew Printing for the swagger shortcode was optimized to expand sections that are usually closed in interactive mode. This requires print support to be configured.\n5.2.0 (2022-08-03) Change If you’ve set collapsibleMenu = true in your hugo.toml, the menu will be expanded if a search term is found in a collapsed submenu. The menu will return to its initial collapse state once the search term does not match any submenus. 5.1.0 (2022-07-15) 0.95.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange Because the print preview URLs were non deterministic for normal pages in comparison to page bundles, this is now changed. Each print preview is now accessible by adding a index.print.html to the default URL.\nYou can revert this behavior by overwriting the print output format setting in your hugo.tomlto:\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputFormats] [outputFormats.print] baseName = 'index' isHTML = true mediaType = 'text/html' name = 'print' path = '_print' permalinkable = false outputFormats: print: baseName: index isHTML: true mediaType: text/html name: print path: _print permalinkable: false { \"outputFormats\": { \"print\": { \"baseName\": \"index\", \"isHTML\": true, \"mediaType\": \"text/html\", \"name\": \"print\", \"path\": \"_print\", \"permalinkable\": false } } } 5.0.0 (2022-07-05) Breaking The theme changed how JavaScript and CSS dependencies are loaded to provide a better performance. In case you’ve added own JavaScript code that depends on the themes jQuery implementation, you have to put it into a separate *.js file (if not already) and add the defer keyword to the script element. Eg.\n\u003cscript defer src=\"myscript.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change The way archetypes are used to generate output has changed. The new systems allows you, to redefine existing archetypes or even generate your own ones.\nYour existing markdown files will still work like before and therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade. Nevertheless, it is recommended to adapt your existing markdown files to the new way as follows:\nfor your home page, add the frontmatter parameter archetype = \"home\" and remove the leading heading\nfor all files containing the deprecated frontmatter parameter chapter = true, replace it with archetype = \"chapter\" and remove the leading headings\nChange The frontmatter options pre / post were renamed to menuPre / menuPost. The old options will still be used if the new options aren’t set. Therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade.\nNew Adding new partials heading-pre.html / heading-post.html and according frontmatter options headingPre / headingPost to modify the way your page`s main heading gets styled.\nNew The new shortcode math is available to add beautiful math and chemical formulae. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n4.2.0 (2022-06-23) Breaking The second parameter for the include shortcode was switched in meaning and was renamed from showfirstheading to hidefirstheading. If you haven’t used this parameter in your shortcode, the default behavior hasn’t changed and you don’t need to change anything.\nIf you’ve used the second boolean parameter, you have to rename it and invert its value to achieve the same behavior.\nChange Previously, if the tabs shortcode could not find a tab item because, the tabs ended up empty. Now the first tab is selected instead.\nChange The landingPageURL was removed from hugo.toml. You can safely remove this as well from your configuration as it is not used anymore. The theme will detect the landing page URL automatically and will point to the project’s homepage. If you want to support a different link, overwrite the logo.html partial.\nNew All shortcodes can now be also called from your partials. Examples for this are added to the documentation of each shortcode.\n4.1.0 (2022-06-12) New While fixing issues with the search functionality for non Latin languages, you can now configure to have multiple languages on a single page. 4.0.0 (2022-06-05) Breaking The custom_css config parameter was removed from the configuration. If used in an existing installation, it can be achieved by overriding the custom-header.html template in a much more generic manner.\nBreaking Because anchor hover color was not configurable without introducing more complexity to the variant stylesheets, we decided to remove --MAIN-ANCHOR-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the anchors now get their colors from --MAIN-LINK-color and --MAIN-ANCHOR-HOVER-color respectively.\nNew All shortcodes now support named parameter. The positional parameter are still supported but will not be enhanced with new features, so you don’t need to change anything in your installation.\nThis applies to expand, include, notice and siteparam.\nNew The button shortcode received some love and now has a parameter for the color style similar to other shortcodes.\nNew New colors --PRIMARY-color and --SECONDARY-color were added to provide easier modification of your custom style. Shortcodes with a color style can now have primary or secondary as additional values.\nThese two colors are the default for other, more specific color variables. You don’t need to change anything in your existing custom color stylesheets as those variables get reasonable default values.\nNew Translation into Polish. This language is not supported for search.\nNew The documentation for all shortcodes were revised.\n3.4.0 (2022-04-03) Breaking If you had previously overwritten the custom-footer.html partial to add visual elements below the content of your page, you have to move this content to the new partial content-footer.html. custom-footer.html was never meant to contain HTML other than additional styles and JavaScript.\nNew If you prefer expandable/collapsible menu items, you can now set collapsibleMenu=true in your hugo.toml. This will add arrows to all menu items that contain sub menus. The menu will expand/collapse without navigation if you click on an arrow.\nNew You can activate print support in your hugo.toml to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site.\nNew Translation into Traditional Chinese.\n3.3.0 (2022-03-28) New Introduction of new CSS variables to set the font. The theme distinguishes between --MAIN-font for all content text and --CODE-font for inline or block code. There are additional overrides for all headings. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for all available variables.\nNew The new shortcode swagger is available to include a UI for REST OpenAPI specifications. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n3.2.0 (2022-03-19) 0.93.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange In this release the Mermaid JavaScript library will only be loaded on demand if the page contains a Mermaid shortcode or is using Mermaid codefences. This changes the behavior of disableMermaid config option as follows: If a Mermaid shortcode or codefence is found, the option will be ignored and Mermaid will be loaded regardlessly.\nThe option is still useful in case you are using scripting to set up your graph. In this case no shortcode or codefence is involved and the library is not loaded by default. In this case you can set disableMermaid=false in your frontmatter to force the library to be loaded. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for an example.\nNew Additional color variant variable --MERMAID-theme to set the variant’s Mermaid theme. This causes the Mermaid theme to switch with the color variant if it defers from the setting of the formerly selected color variant.\n3.1.0 (2022-03-15) New attachment and notice shortcodes have a new parameter to override the default icon. Allowed values are all Font Awesome 5 Free icons. 3.0.0 (2022-02-22) Breaking We made changes to the menu footer. If you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may have to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) in your partial. For a reference take a look into the menu-footer.html partial that is coming with the exampleSite.\nThis change was made to allow your own menu footer to be placed right after the so called prefooter that comes with the theme (containing the language switch and Clear history functionality).\nBreaking We have changed the default colors from the original Learn theme (the purple menu header) to the Relearn defaults (the light green menu header) as used in the official documentation.\nThis change will only affect your installation if you’ve not set the themeVariant parameter in your hugo.toml. If you still want to use the Learn color variant, you have to explicitly set themeVariant=\"learn\" in your hugo.toml.\nNote, that this will also affect your site if viewed with Internet Explorer 11 but in this case it can not be reconfigured as Internet Explorer does not support CSS variables.\nChange Due to a bug, that we couldn’t fix in a general manner for color variants, we decided to remove --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-ICONS-color and introduced --MENU-SEARCH-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange For consistency reasons, we renamed --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-color to --MENU-SEARCH-BORDER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew With this release you are now capable to define your own dark mode variants.\nTo make this possible, we have introduced a lot more color variables you can use in your color variants. Your old variants will still work and don’t need to be changed as appropriate fallback values are used by the theme. Nevertheless, the new colors allow for much more customization.\nTo see what’s now possible, see the new variants relearn-dark and neon that are coming with this release.\nNew To make the creation of new variants easier for you, we’ve added a new interactive theme variant generator. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\nNew You can now configure multiple color variants in your hugo.toml. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer. See the documentation for configuration.\nNote, that the new variant selector will not work with Internet Explorer 11 as it does not support CSS variables. Therefore, the variant selector will not be displayed with Internet Explorer 11.\n2.9.0 (2021-11-19) Breaking This release removes the themes implementation of ref/relref in favor for Hugo’s standard implementation. This is because of inconsistencies with the themes implementation. In advantage, your project becomes standard compliant and exchanging this theme in your project to some other theme will be effortless.\nIn a standard compliant form you must not link to the *.md file but to its logical name. You’ll see, referencing other pages becomes much easier. All three types result in the same reference:\nType Non-Standard Standard Branch bundle basics/configuration/_index.md basics/configuration Leaf bundle basics/configuration/index.md basics/configuration Page basics/configuration.md basics/configuration If you’ve linked from a page of one language to a page of another language, conversion is a bit more difficult but Hugo got you covered as well.\nAlso, the old themes implementation allowed refs to non-existing content. This will cause Hugo’s implementation to show the error below and abort the generation. If your project relies on this old behavior, you can reconfigure the error handling of Hugo’s implementation.\nIn the best case your usage of the old implementation is already standard compliant and you don’t need to change anything. You’ll notice this very easily once you’ve started hugo server after an upgrade and no errors are written to the console.\nYou may see errors on the console after the update in the form:\nERROR 2021/11/19 22:29:10 [en] REF_NOT_FOUND: Ref \"basics/configuration/_index.md\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\\exampleSite\\content\\_index.en.md:19:22\": page not foundIn this case, you must apply one of two options:\nStart up a text editor with regular expression support for search and replace. Search for (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*?)(?:/_index|/index)?(?:\\.md)?(#[^\"]*?)?\" and replace it by $1$2\" in all *.md files. This is the recommended choice.\nCopy the old implementation files theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/ref.html and theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/relref.html to your own projects layouts/shortcode/ref.html and layouts/shortcode/relref.html respectively. This is not recommended as your project will still rely on non-standard behavior afterwards.\n2.8.0 (2021-11-03) Change Although never officially documented, this release removes the font Novacento/Novecento. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with Work Sans. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for Czech.\nNew The theme now supports favicons served from static/images/ named as favicon or logo in SVG, PNG or ICO format out of the box. An overridden partial layouts/partials/favicon.html may not be necessary anymore in most cases.\nNew You can hide the table of contents menu for the whole site by setting the disableToc option in your hugo.toml. For an example see the example configuration.\n2.7.0 (2021-10-24) New Optional second parameter for notice shortcode to set title in box header. 2.6.0 (2021-10-21) New Your site can now be served from a subfolder if you set baseURL in your hugo.toml. See the documentation for a detailed example. 2.5.0 (2021-10-08) Change New colors --CODE-BLOCK-color and --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color were added to provide a fallback for Hugo’s syntax highlighting in case no language was given or the language is unsupported. Ideally the colors are set to the same values as the ones from your chosen chroma style. 2.4.0 (2021-10-07) Change Creation of customized stylesheets was simplified down to only contain the CSS variables. Everything else can and should be deleted from your custom stylesheet to assure everything works fine. For the predefined stylesheet variants, this change is already included.\nNew Hidden pages are displayed by default in their according tags page. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableTagHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus for the whole site by setting the alwaysopen option in your hugo.toml. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New frontmatter ordersectionsby option to change immediate children sorting in menu and children shortcode. Possible values are title or weight.\nNew Alternate content of a page is now advertised in the HTML meta tags. See Hugo documentation.\n2.3.0 (2021-09-13) 0.81.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nNew Showcase multilanguage features by providing a documentation translation “fer us pirrrates”. There will be no other translations besides the original English one and the Pirates one due to maintenance constraints.\n2.2.0 (2021-09-09) New Hidden pages are displayed by default in the sitemap generated by Hugo and are therefore visible for search engine indexing. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSeoHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml. 2.1.0 (2021-09-07) 0.69.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange In case the site’s structure contains additional *.md files not part of the site (eg files that are meant to be included by site pages - see CHANGELOG.md in the exampleSite), they will now be ignored by the search.\nNew Hidden pages are indexed for the site search by default. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSearchHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew If a search term is found in an expand shortcode, the expand will be opened.\nNew The menu will scroll the active item into view on load.\n2.0.0 (2021-08-28) Change Syntax highlighting was switched to the built in Hugo mechanism. You may need to configure a new stylesheet or decide to roll you own as described on in the Hugo documentation\nChange In the predefined stylesheets there was a typo and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVERED-color must be changed to --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange --MENU-HOME-LINK-color and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color were missing in the documentation. You should add them to your custom stylesheets if you want to override the defaults.\nChange Arrow navigation and children shortcode were ignoring setting for ordersectionsby. This is now changed and may result in different sorting order of your sub pages.\nChange If hidden pages are accessed directly by typing their URL, they will be exposed in the menu.\nChange A page without a title will be treated as hidden=true.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus in the frontmatter. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New partials for defining pre/post content for menu items and the content. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Shortcode children with new parameter containerstyle.\nNew New shortcode include to include arbitrary file content into a page.\n1.2.0 (2021-07-26) New Shortcode expand with new parameter to open on page load. 1.1.0 (2021-07-02) Breaking Mermaid diagrams can now be panned and zoomed. This isn’t configurable yet.\nNew Mermaid config options can be set in hugo.toml.\n1.0.0 (2021-07-01) 0.65.0 The requirement for the Hugo version of this theme is the same as for the Learn theme version 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01.\nNew Initial fork of the Learn theme based on Learn 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01. This introduces no new features besides a global rename to Relearn and a new logo. For the reasons behind forking the Learn theme, see this comment in the Learn issues.",

    "content": "Using the command: hugo new [relative new content path], you can start a content file with the date and title automatically set. While this is a welcome feature, active writers need more: archetypes. These are preconfigured skeleton pages with default frontmatter.\nThe Relearn theme defines some few archetypes of pages but you are free to define new ones to your liking. All can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being the layout of the content.\nPredefined Archetypes Home A Home page is the starting page of your project. It’s best to have only one page of this kind in your project.\nTo create a home page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind home _index.mdThis leads to a file with the following content\n​ _index.md +++ archetype = \"home\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" +++ Lorem Ipsum. Chapter A Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found below it.\nTo create a chapter page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind chapter \u003cname\u003e/_index.mdThis leads to a file with the following content\n​ _index.md +++ archetype = \"chapter\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" weight = 1 +++ Lorem Ipsum. The weight number will be used to generate the subtitle of the chapter page, set the number to a consecutive value starting at 1 for each new chapter level.\nDefault A Default page is any other content page. If you set an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, this archetype will be used to generate the page.\nTo create a default page, run either one of the following commands\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e/_index.mdor\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e.mdThis leads to a file with the following content\n​ *.md +++ title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" +++ Lorem Ipsum. Self defined Archetypes If you are in need of further archetypes you can define your own or even redefine existing ones.\nTemplate Define a template file in your project at archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.md and make sure it has at least the frontmatter parameter for that archetype like\n​ \u003ckind\u003e.md +++ archetype = \"\u003ckind\u003e\" +++ Afterwards you can generate new content files of that kind with the following command\nhugo new --kind \u003ckind\u003e \u003cname\u003e/_index.mdPartials To define how your archetypes are rendered, define corresponding partial files in your projects directory layouts/partials/archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.\nIf you use an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, the default archetype will be used to generate the page.\nRelated to each archetype, several hook partial files in the form of \u003chook\u003e.html can be given inside each archetype directory. If a partial for a specific hook is missing, no output is generated for this hook.\nThe following hooks are used:\nName Notes styleclass Defines a set of CSS classes to be added to the HTML’s \u003cmain\u003e element. You can use these classes to define own CSS rules in your custom-header.html article Defines the HTML how to render your content Take a look at the existing archetypes of this theme to get an idea how to utilize it.\nOutput formats Each hook file can be overridden of a specific output format. Eg. if you define a new output format PLAINTEXT in your hugo.toml, you can add a file layouts/partials/archetypes/default.plaintext.html to change the way how normal content is written for that output format.",

    "content": "Let’s face it: Writing content for the web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid HTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. John Gruber\nTip Bookmark this page for easy future reference!\nStandard and Extensions If not otherwise noted, the showed examples adhere to the Commonmark standard. In addition the theme supports the following extensions that can be activated in your hugo.toml or are built into the theme:\nGFM Extension on top of standard Markdown adhering to GitHub Flavored Markdown.\nPHP Extension on top of standard Markdown adhering to PHP Markdown.\nPants Extension by John Gruber adhering to SmartyPants.\nHugo Hugo Extra Extension supported by Hugo.\nRelearn Extension specific to this theme.\nHTML If the usage of HTML is allowed, the theme supports styling for further HTML elements.\nParagraphs In Markdown your content usually spans the whole available document width. This is called a block. Blocks are always separated by whitespace to their adjacent blocks in the resulting document.\nAny text not starting with a special sign is written as normal, plain text paragraph block and must be separated to its adjacent blocks by empty lines.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nHeadings A good idea is to structure your content using headings and subheadings. HTML-headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level.\nIn Hugo you usually don’t use h1 as this is generated by your theme and you should only have one such element in a document.\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Result h1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading Horizontal Rules To further structure your content you can add horizontal rules. They create a “thematic break” between paragraph blocks. In Markdown, you can create it with three consecutive dashes ---.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. --- Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nText Markers Bold You can show importance of a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight by enclosing it with two asterisks **.\nI am rendered with **bold text** Result I am rendered with bold text\nItalics You can emphasize a snippet of text with italics by enclosing it with underscores _.\nI am rendered with _italicized text_ Result I am rendered with italicized text\nMarked Text You can mark text in the predefined accent color of your stylesheet.\nHugo Since Hugo 0.126.0, you can activate this through the Hugo Extra Extension in your hugo.toml\n==Parts== of this text ==are marked!==HTML You can also use it by configuring Hugo for usage of HTML.\n\u003cmark\u003eParts\u003c/mark\u003e of this text \u003cmark\u003eare marked!\u003c/mark\u003e Result Parts of this text are marked!\nInserted Text You can mark text additions to existing text.\nHugo Since Hugo 0.126.0, you can activate this through the Hugo Extra Extension in your hugo.toml\nThe ++hot, new++ stuffHTML You can also use it by configuring Hugo for usage of HTML.\nThe \u003cins\u003ehot, new\u003c/ins\u003e stuff Result The hot, new stuff\nDeleted Text GFM You can do strikethroughs by enclosing text with two tildes ~~.\n~~Strike through~~ this text Result Strike through this text\nSpecial Typesetting Text Substitution Pants You can combine multiple punctuation characters to single typographic entities. This will only be applied to text outside of code blocks or inline code.\nDouble quotes `\"` and single quotes `'` of enclosed text are replaced by **\"double curly quotes\"** and **'single curly quotes'**. Double dashes `--` and triple dashes `---` are replaced by en-dash **--** and em-dash **---** entities. Double arrows pointing left `\u003c\u003c` or right `\u003e\u003e` are replaced by arrow **\u003c\u003c** and **\u003e\u003e** entities. Three consecutive dots `...` are replaced by an ellipsis **...** entity. Result Double quotes \" and single quotes ' of enclosed text are replaced by “double curly quotes” and ‘single curly quotes’.\nDouble dashes -- and triple dashes --- are replaced by en-dash – and em-dash — entities.\nDouble arrows pointing left \u003c\u003c or right \u003e\u003e are replaced by arrow « and » entities.\nThree consecutive dots ... are replaced by an ellipsis … entity.\nSubscript and Superscript You can also use subscript and superscript text. For more complex stuff, you can use the math shortcode.\nHugo Since Hugo 0.126.0, you can activate this through the Hugo Extra Extension in your hugo.toml\nHow many liters H~2~O fit into 1dm^3^?HTML You can also use it by configuring Hugo for usage of HTML.\nHow many liters H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003eO fit into 1dm\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e? Result How many liters H2O fit into 1dm3?\nKeyboard Shortcuts HTML You can use the \u003ckbd\u003e element to style keyboard shortcuts.\nPress \u003ckbd\u003eSTRG\u003c/kbd\u003e \u003ckbd\u003eALT\u003c/kbd\u003e \u003ckbd\u003eDEL\u003c/kbd\u003e to end your shift early. Result Press STRG ALT DEL to end your shift early.\nLists Unordered You can write a list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.\nIt is possible to nest lists by indenting an item for the next sublevel.\nYou may use any of -, * or + to denote bullets for each list item but should not switch between those symbols inside one whole list.\n- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet - Consectetur adipiscing elit - Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem - Ac tristique libero volutpat at - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit - Phasellus iaculis neque - Purus sodales ultricies - Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem Ac tristique libero volutpat at Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Phasellus iaculis neque Purus sodales ultricies Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Ordered You can create a list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.\nIt is possible to nest lists by indenting an item for the next sublevel.\nMarkdown will automatically number each of your items consecutively. This means, the order number you are providing is irrelevant.\n1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 3. Consectetur adipiscing elit 1. Integer molestie lorem at massa 7. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet 99. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit 1. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 1. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 17. Eget porttitor lorem Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem Tasks GFM You can add task lists resulting in checked or unchecked non-clickable items\n- [x] Basic Test - [ ] More Tests - [x] View - [x] Hear - [ ] Smell Result Basic Test More Tests View Hear Smell Definitions PHP Definition lists are made of terms and definitions of these terms, much like in a dictionary.\nA definition list in Markdown Extra is made of a single-line term followed by a colon and the definition for that term. You can also associate more than one term to a definition.\nIf you add empty lines around the definition terms, additional vertical space will be generated. Also multiple paragraphs are possible\nApple : Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae. : An American computer company. Orange : The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus. You can make juice out of it. : A telecommunication company. You can't make juice out of it. Result Apple Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae. An American computer company. Orange The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus. You can make juice out of it.\nA telecommunication company. You can’t make juice out of it.\nCode Inline Code Inline snippets of code can be wrapped with backticks `.\nIn this example, `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e` is marked as code. Result In this example, \u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e is marked as code.\nIndented Code Block A simple code block can be generated by indenting several lines of code by at least two spaces.\nBe impressed by my advanced code: // Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Result Be impressed by my advanced code:\n// Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Fenced Code Block If you want to gain more control of your code block you can enclose your code by at least three backticks ``` a so called fence.\nGFM You can also add a language specifier directly after the opening fence, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied according to the selected language in the rendered HTML.\nSee Code Highlighting for additional documentation.\n```js { name: \"Claus\", surname: \"Santa\", profession: \"courier\", age: 666, address: { city: \"North Pole\", postalCode: 1, country: \"Arctic\" }, friends: [ \"Dasher\", \"Dancer\", \"Prancer\", \"Vixen\", \"Comet\", \"Cupid\", \"Donder\", \"Blitzen\", \"Rudolph\" ] }; ``` Result { name: \"Claus\", surname: \"Santa\", profession: \"courier\", age: 666, address: { city: \"North Pole\", postalCode: 1, country: \"Arctic\" }, friends: [ \"Dasher\", \"Dancer\", \"Prancer\", \"Vixen\", \"Comet\", \"Cupid\", \"Donder\", \"Blitzen\", \"Rudolph\" ] }; Tables GFM You can create tables by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | |--------|-------------| | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. | | ext | extension to be used for dest files. | Result Option Description data path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. engine engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. ext extension to be used for dest files. Aligned Columns Adding a colon on the left and/or right side of the dashes below any heading will align the text for that column accordingly.\n| Option | Number | Description | |-------:|:------:|:------------| | data | 1 | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | 2 | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. | | ext | 3 | extension to be used for dest files. | Result Option Number Description data 1 path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. engine 2 engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. ext 3 extension to be used for dest files. Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document add \u003e before any text you want to quote.\nBlockquotes can also be nested.\n\u003e Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue. Nunc augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi. \u003e \u003e \u003e Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam. \u003e \u003e Mauris sit amet ligula egestas, feugiat metus tincidunt, luctus libero. Donec congue finibus tempor. Vestibulum aliquet sollicitudin erat, ut aliquet purus posuere luctus. Result Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue. Nunc augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi.\nSed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.\nMauris sit amet ligula egestas, feugiat metus tincidunt, luctus libero. Donec congue finibus tempor. Vestibulum aliquet sollicitudin erat, ut aliquet purus posuere luctus.\nLinks Autolink GFM Absolute URLs will automatically be converted into a link.\nThis is a link to https://example.com. Result This is a link to https://example.com.\nBasic Link You can explicitly define links in case you want to use non-absolute URLs or want to give different text.\n[Assemble](http://assemble.io) Result Assemble\nLink with Tooltip For even further information, you can add an additional text, displayed in a tooltip on hovering over the link.\n[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \"Visit Upstage!\") Result Upstage\nLink References Links can be simplyfied for recurring reuse by using a reference ID to later define the URL location. This simplyfies writing if you want to use a link more than once in a document.\n[Example][somelinkID] [somelinkID]: https://example.com \"Go to example domain\" Result Example\nFootnotes PHP Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things, a marker in the text that will become a superscript number and a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes.\nUsually the list of footnotes will be shown at the end of your document. If we use a footnote in a notice box it will instead be listed at the end of its box.\nFootnotes can contain block elements, which means that you can put multiple paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and so on in a footnote. It works the same as for list items, just indent the following paragraphs by four spaces in the footnote definition.\nThat's some text with a footnote[^1] [^1]: And that's the footnote. That's some more text with a footnote.[^someid] [^someid]: Anything of interest goes here. Blue light glows blue. Result That’s some text with a footnote1\nThat’s some more text with a footnote.2\nAnd that’s the footnote. ↩︎\nAnything of interest goes here.\nBlue light glows blue. ↩︎\nImages Basic Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation mark.\n![Spock](https://octodex.github.com/images/spocktocat.png) Result Image with Tooltip Like links, images can also be given a tooltip.\n![Picard](https://octodex.github.com/images/jean-luc-picat.jpg \"Jean Luc Picard\") Result Image References Images can also be linked by reference ID to later define the URL location. This simplyfies writing if you want to use an image more than once in a document.\n![La Forge][laforge] [laforge]: https://octodex.github.com/images/trekkie.jpg \"Geordi La Forge\" Result Image Effects Relearn This theme allows additional non-standard formatting by setting query parameter at the end of the image URL. The default behavior is configurable through your hugo.toml or frontmatter parameter.\nResizing Add query parameter width and/or height to the link image to resize the image. Values are CSS values (default is auto).\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?width=20vw) Result ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px) Result ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px\u0026width=40vw) Result CSS Classes Add a query parameter classes to the link image to add CSS classes. Add some of the predefined values or even define your own in your CSS.\nShadow ![Spidertocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/spidertocat.png?classes=shadow) Result Border ![DrOctocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/droctocat.png?classes=border) Result Left ![Supertocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/okal-eltocat.jpg?classes=left) Result Right ![Riddlocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/riddlocat.jpg?classes=right) Result Inline ![Spidertocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/spidertocat.png?classes=inline) ![DrOctocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/droctocat.png?classes=inline) ![Supertocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/okal-eltocat.jpg?classes=inline) ![Riddlocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/riddlocat.jpg?classes=inline) Result Combination ![X-tocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/xtocat.jpg?classes=shadow,border,left) Result Lightbox Add the query parameter lightbox=false to the image link to disable the lightbox.\n![Homercat](https://octodex.github.com/images/homercat.png?lightbox=false) Result Note If you want to wrap an image in a link and lightbox=true is your default setting, you have to explicitly disable the lightbox to avoid it to hijacking your link like:\n[![Homercat](https://octodex.github.com/images/homercat.png?lightbox=false)](https://octodex.github.com/#homercat)",

It’s not replaced with default language content.\nTip Use slug frontmatter parameter to translate urls too.\nSearch In case each page’s content is written in one single language only, the above configuration will already configure the site’s search functionality correctly.\nWarning Although the theme supports a wide variety of supported languages, the site’s search via the Lunr search library does not. You’ll see error reports in your browsers console log for each unsupported language. Currently unsupported are:\nCzech Indonesian Polish Swahili Search with mixed language support In case your page’s content contains text in multiple languages (e.g. you are writing a Russian documentation for your english API), you can add those languages to your hugo.toml to broaden search.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] additionalContentLanguage = ['en'] params: additionalContentLanguage: - en { \"params\": { \"additionalContentLanguage\": [ \"en\" ] } } As this is an array, you can add multiple additional languages.\nNote Keep in mind that the language code required here, is the base language code. E.g. if you have additional content in zh-CN, you have to add just zh to this parameter.\nOverwrite translation strings Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (Edit button, Search placeholder and so on). Translations are available in English and Piratized English but you may use another language or want to override default values.\nTo override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder i18n/\u003cidlanguage\u003e.toml and inspire yourself from the theme themes/hugo-theme-relearn/i18n/en.toml\nDisable language switching Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.\nJust set disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true in your hugo.toml\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true params: disableLanguageSwitchingButton: true { \"params\": { \"disableLanguageSwitchingButton\": true } } ",

If you don’t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you learn more about it by following this great documentation for beginners.\nTip The following tutorial leads you through the steps of creating a first, minimal new site.\nYou don’t need to edit any files besides your hugo.toml and only need to execute the commands in the given order.\nCreate your Project Hugo provides the new command to create a new website:\nhugo new site my-new-siteAfter that change into the directory:\ncd my-new-siteEvery upcoming command will be executed from inside your new site’s root.\nInstall the Theme Downloading as Archive You can download the theme as .zip archive and extract its content into them themes/hugo-theme-relearn directory.\nAfterwards add this at the end of your hugo.toml.\nhugo. toml yaml json theme = 'hugo-theme-relearn' theme: hugo-theme-relearn { \"theme\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\" } Using Hugo’s Module System You can install the Relearn theme by following the standard documentation using Hugo’s module system:\nhugo mod init example.comAfterwards add this at the end of your hugo.toml.\nhugo. toml yaml json [module] [[module.imports]] path = 'github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn' module: imports: - path: github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn { \"module\": { \"imports\": [ { \"path\": \"github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn\" } ] } } Using Git Submodules If you plan to store your project in a git repository you can create one with:\ngit initNow add the theme as a submodule by:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git themes/hugo-theme-relearnAfterwards add this at the end of your hugo.toml.\nhugo. toml yaml json theme = 'hugo-theme-relearn' theme: hugo-theme-relearn { \"theme\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\" } Create your Home Page If you don’t create a home page, yet, the theme will generate a placeholder text with instructions on how to proceed.\nStart your journey by creating a home page:\nhugo new --kind home _index.mdThe newly created home page content/_index.md is empty and you obviously should add some meaningful content.\nCreate your First Chapter Page Chapters are meant to be top level pages that contain other child pages. They have a special layout style and often just contain the title and a brief abstract of the section.\nNow create your first chapter page with the following command:\nhugo new --kind chapter basics/_index.mdWhen opening the newly created file content/basics/_index.md, you should see the weight frontmatter with a number. This will be used to generate the subtitle of the chapter page, and should be set to a consecutive value starting at 1 for each chapter level.\nCreate your First Content Pages Then create content pages inside the previously created chapter. Here are three ways to create content in the chapter:\nhugo new basics/first-content/_index.md hugo new basics/second-content/index.md hugo new basics/third-content.mdFeel free to edit those files by adding some sample content and replacing the title value in the beginning of the files.\nNote Please note that Hugo overrides the default archetype template coming with this theme when using hugo new site my-new-site. To actually see your page later, you have to remove the draft=true from the page’s frontmatter.\nTesting your Website Locally Launch your new web site by using the following command:\nhugo serveGo to http://localhost:1313 in your browser.\nYou should notice a few things:\nThe home page contains your provided text. You have the menu Basics in the sidebar. Clicking on it reveals three submenus with names equal to the title properties in the previously created content pages. While you are running hugo serve your page refreshes automatically when you change a content page. Neat! Build and Deploy your Website When your site is ready to be deployed, run the following command:\nhugoA public directory will be generated, containing all content and assets for your web site.\nIt now can be deployed to any web server by simply uploading its contents or you can check out one of Hugo’s many other deployment options.\nNote If you are storing your web site in git, commit all but the public directory.",

    "content": "The Relearn theme provides configuration options to change your site’s colors, favicon and logo. This allows you to easily align your site visuals to your desired style. Most of these options are exposed through so called color variants.\nA color variant lets you customize various visual effects of your site like almost any color, used fonts, color schemes of print, syntax highligtning, Mermaid and the OpenAPI shortcode, etc. It contains of a CSS file and optional configuration options in your hugo.toml.\nThe Relearn theme ships with a wide set of different color variants. You can use them as-is, copy them over and use them as a starting point for your customizations or just create completely new variants unique to your site. The interactive variant generator may help you with this task.\nOnce configured in your hugo.toml, you can select them with the variant selector at the bottom of the menu.\nChange the Variant (Simple) Single Variant Set the themeVariant value to the name of your theme file. That’s it! Your site will be displayed in this variant only.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = 'relearn-light' params: themeVariant: relearn-light { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": \"relearn-light\" } } Note Your theme variant file must reside in your site’s assets/css directory and the file name must start with theme- and end in .css. In the above example, the path of your theme file must be assets/css/theme-relearn-light.css.\nIf you want to make changes to a shipped color variant, create a copy in your site’s assets/css directory. Don’t edit the file in the theme’s directory!\nMultiple Variants You can also set multiple variants. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer if the array contains more than one entry.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = ['relearn-light', 'relearn-dark'] params: themeVariant: - relearn-light - relearn-dark { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] } } Tip The theme provides an advanced configuration mode, combining the functionality for multiple variants with the below possibilities of adjusting to your OS settings and syntax highlighting and even more!\nAlthough all options documented here are still working, the advanced configuration options are the recommended way to configure your color variants. See below.\nAdjust to OS Settings You can also cause the site to adjust to your OS settings for light/dark mode. Just set the themeVariant to auto to become an auto mode variant. That’s it.\nYou can use the auto value with the single or multiple variants option. If you are using multiple variants, you can drop auto at any position in the option’s array, but usually it makes sense to set it in the first position and make it the default.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = ['auto', 'red'] params: themeVariant: - auto - red { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"auto\", \"red\" ] } } If you don’t configure anything else, the theme will default to use relearn-light for light mode and relearn-dark for dark mode. These defaults are overwritten by the first two non-auto options of your themeVariant option if present.\nIn the above example, you would end with red for light mode and the default of relearn-dark for dark mode.\nIf you don’t like that behavior, you can explicitly set themeVariantAuto. The first entry in the array is the color variant for light mode, the second for dark mode.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariantAuto = ['learn', 'neon'] params: themeVariantAuto: - learn - neon { \"params\": { \"themeVariantAuto\": [ \"learn\", \"neon\" ] } } Change the Favicon If your favicon is a SVG, PNG or ICO, just drop your image in your site’s static/images/ directory and name it favicon.svg, favicon.png or favicon.ico respectively.\nIf you want to adjust your favicon according to your OS settings for light/dark mode, add the image files static/images/favicon-light.svg and static/images/favicon-dark.svg to your site’s directory, respectively, corresponding to your file format. In case some of the files are missing, the theme falls back to favicon.svg for each missing file. All supplied favicons must be of the same file format.\nIf no favicon file is found, the theme will lookup the alternative filename logo in the same location and will repeat the search for the list of supported file types.\nIf you need to change this default behavior, create a new file layouts/partials/favicon.html in your site’s directory and write something like this:\n​ layouts/partials/favicon.html \u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/images/favicon.bmp\" type=\"image/bmp\"\u003e Change the Logo Create a new file in layouts/partials/logo.html of your site. Then write any HTML you want. You could use an img HTML tag and reference an image created under the static folder, or you could paste a SVG definition!\nNote The size of the logo will adapt automatically.\nSyntax Highlighting If you want to switch the syntax highlighting theme together with your color variant, you need to configure your installation according to Hugo’s documentation and provide a syntax highlighting stylesheet file.\nYou can use a one of the shipped stylesheet files or use Hugo to generate a file for you. The file must be written to assets/css/chroma-\u003cNAME\u003e.css. To use it with your color variant you have to define --CODE-theme: \u003cNAME\u003e in the color variant stylesheet file.\nFor an example, take a look into theme-relearn-light.css and hugo.toml of the exampleSite.\nChange the Variant (Advanced) The theme offers a new way to configure theme variants and all of the aspects above inside of a single configuration item. This comes with some features previously unsupported.\nLike with the multiple variants option, you are defining your theme variants in an array but now not by simple strings but in a table with suboptions.\nAgain, in this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer if the array contains more than one entry.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = ['relearn-light', 'relearn-dark'] params: themeVariant: - relearn-light - relearn-dark { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] } } you now write it that way:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-dark' params: themeVariant: - identifier: relearn-light - identifier: relearn-dark { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ { \"identifier\": \"relearn-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-dark\" } ] } } The identifier option is mandatory and equivalent to the string in the first example. Further options can be configured, see the table below.\nParameter Name Default Notes identifier \u003cempty\u003e Must correspond to the name of a color variant either in your site’s or the theme’s directory in the form assets/css/theme-\u003cIDENTIFIER\u003e.css. name see notes The name to be displayed in the variant selector. If not set, the identifier is used in a human readable form. auto \u003cempty\u003e If set, the variant is treated as an auto mode variant. It has the same behavior as the themeVariantAuto option. The first entry in the array is the color variant for light mode, the second for dark mode. Defining auto mode variants with the advanced options has the benefit that you can now have multiple auto mode variants instead of just one with the simple options. Example Configuration of This Site hugo. toml yaml json [params] [[params.themeVariant]] auto = [] identifier = 'relearn-auto' name = 'Relearn Light/Dark' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-dark' [[params.themeVariant]] auto = ['zen-light', 'zen-dark'] identifier = 'zen-auto' name = 'Zen Light/Dark' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'zen-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'zen-dark' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'neon' params: themeVariant: - auto: [] identifier: relearn-auto name: Relearn Light/Dark - identifier: relearn-light - identifier: relearn-dark - auto: - zen-light - zen-dark identifier: zen-auto name: Zen Light/Dark - identifier: zen-light - identifier: zen-dark - identifier: neon { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ { \"auto\": [], \"identifier\": \"relearn-auto\", \"name\": \"Relearn Light/Dark\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-dark\" }, { \"auto\": [ \"zen-light\", \"zen-dark\" ], \"identifier\": \"zen-auto\", \"name\": \"Zen Light/Dark\" }, { \"identifier\": \"zen-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"zen-dark\" }, { \"identifier\": \"neon\" } ] } } Modify Shipped Variants In case you like a shipped variant but only want to tweak some aspects, you have two choices:\nCopy and change\nYou can copy the shipped variant file from the theme’s assets/css directory to the site’s assets/css directory and either store it with the same name or give it a new name. Edit the settings and save the new file. Afterwards you can use it in your hugo.toml by the chosen name.\nCreate and import\nYou can create a new variant file in the site’s assets/css directory and give it a new name. Import the shipped variant, add the settings you want to change and save the new file. Afterwards you can use it in your hugo.toml by the chosen name.\nFor example, you want to use the relearn-light variant but want to change the syntax highlighting schema to the one used in the neon variant. For that, create a new assets/css/theme-my-branding.css in your site’s directory and add the following lines:\n​ assets/css/theme-my-branding.css @import \"theme-relearn-light.css\"; :root { --CODE-theme: neon; /* name of the chroma stylesheet file */ --CODE-BLOCK-color: rgba( 226, 228, 229, 1 ); /* fallback color for code text */ --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color: rgba( 40, 42, 54, 1 ); /* fallback color for code background */ } Afterwards put this in your hugo.toml to use your new variant:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = 'my-branding' params: themeVariant: my-branding { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": \"my-branding\" } } In comparison to copy and change, this has the advantage that you profit from any adjustments to the relearn-light variant but keep your modifications.",

    "content": "Usage scenarios The theme is usable in different scenarios, requiring the following mandatory settings in your hugo.toml. All settings not mentioned can be set to your liking.\nPublic Web Server from Root hugo. toml yaml json baseURL = 'https://example.com/' baseURL: https://example.com/ { \"baseURL\": \"https://example.com/\" } Public Web Server from Subdirectory hugo. toml yaml json baseURL = 'https://example.com/mysite/' relativeURLs = false baseURL: https://example.com/mysite/ relativeURLs: false { \"baseURL\": \"https://example.com/mysite/\", \"relativeURLs\": false } Private Web Server (LAN) The same settings as with any of the public web server usage scenarios or\nhugo. toml yaml json baseURL = '/' relativeURLs = true baseURL: / relativeURLs: true { \"baseURL\": \"/\", \"relativeURLs\": true } File System hugo. toml yaml json baseURL = '/' relativeURLs = true baseURL: / relativeURLs: true { \"baseURL\": \"/\", \"relativeURLs\": true } Warning Using a baseURL with a subdirectory and relativeURLs=true are mutually exclusive due to the fact, that Hugo does not apply the baseURL correctly.\nIf you need both, you have to generate your site twice but with different settings into separate directories.\nNote Sublemental pages (like sitemap.xml, rss.xml) and generated social media links inside of your pages will always be generated with absolute URLs and will not work if you set relativeURLs=true.\nInfo If you are using uglyURLs=false (Hugo’s default), the theme will append an additional index.html to all page links to make your site be servable from the file system. If you don’t care about the file system and only serve your page via a web server you can generate the links without this:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] disableExplicitIndexURLs = true params: disableExplicitIndexURLs: true { \"params\": { \"disableExplicitIndexURLs\": true } } Activate search If not already present, add the following lines in your hugo.toml file.\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'search'] outputs: home: - html - rss - search { \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"search\" ] } } This will generate a search index file at the root of your public folder ready to be consumed by the Lunr search library.\nActivate dedicated search page You can add a dedicated search page for your page by adding the searchpage outputformat to your home page by adding the following lines in your hugo.toml file. This will cause Hugo to generate a new file http://example.com/mysite/search.html.\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'search', 'searchpage'] outputs: home: - html - rss - search - searchpage { \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"search\", \"searchpage\" ] } } You can access this page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or by typing some search term and pressing ENTER inside of the menu’s search box .\nNote To have Hugo create the dedicated search page successfully, you must not generate the URL http://example.com/mysite/search.html from your own content. This can happen if you set uglyURLs=true in your hugo.toml and defining a Markdown file content/search.md.\nTo make sure, there is no duplicate content for any given URL of your project, run hugo --printPathWarnings.\nActivate print support You can activate print support to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site. Just add the print output format to your home, section and page in your hugo.toml as seen below:\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'print', 'search'] page = ['html', 'rss', 'print'] section = ['html', 'rss', 'print'] outputs: home: - html - rss - print - search page: - html - rss - print section: - html - rss - print { \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\", \"search\" ], \"page\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ], \"section\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ] } } This will add a little printer icon in the top bar. It will switch the page to print preview when clicked. You can then send this page to the printer by using your browser’s usual print functionality.\nNote The resulting URL will not be configured ugly in terms of Hugo’s URL handling even if you’ve set uglyURLs=true in your hugo.toml. This is due to the fact that for one mime type only one suffix can be configured.\nNevertheless, if you’re unhappy with the resulting URLs you can manually redefine outputFormats.print in your own hugo.toml to your liking.\nHome Button Configuration If the disableLandingPageButton option is set to false, a Home button will appear on the left menu. It is an alternative for clicking on the logo. To edit the appearance, you will have to configure the landingPageName for the defined languages:\nhugo. toml yaml json [languages] [languages.en] [languages.en.params] landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" [languages.pir] [languages.pir.params] landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Arrr! Homme\" languages: en: params: landingPageName: \u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home pir: params: landingPageName: \u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Arrr! Homme { \"languages\": { \"en\": { \"params\": { \"landingPageName\": \"\\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e Home\" } }, \"pir\": { \"params\": { \"landingPageName\": \"\\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e Arrr! Homme\" } } } } If this option is not configured for a specific language, they will get their default values:\n​ toml yaml json landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" landingPageName: \u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home { \"landingPageName\": \"\\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e Home\" } The home button is going to look like this:\nSocial Media Meta Tags You can add social media meta tags for the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Cards to your site. These are configured as mentioned in the Hugo docs.\nChange the Menu Width The menu width adjusts automatically for different screen sizes.\nName Screen Width Menu Width S \u003c 48rem 14.375rem M 48rem - 60rem 14.375rem L \u003e= 60rem 18.75rem The values for the screen width breakpoints aren’t configurable.\nIf you want to adjust the menu width you can define the following CSS variables in your custom-header.html. Note that --MENU-WIDTH-S applies to the menu flyout width in mobile mode for small screen sizes.\n:root { --MENU-WIDTH-S: 14.375rem; --MENU-WIDTH-M: 14.375rem; --MENU-WIDTH-L: 18.75rem; }Change the Main Area’s Max Width By default the main area width will only grow to a certain extent if more vertical screen space is available. This is done for readability purposes as long line are usually harder to read.\nIf you are unhappy with the default, you can define the following CSS variable in your custom-header.html and set the value to your liking. If you want to use all available space, select a really big value like 1000rem;\n:root { --MAIN-WIDTH-MAX: 80.25rem; }Own Shortcodes with JavaScript Dependencies Certain shortcodes make use of additional dependencies like JavaScript and CSS files. The theme only loads these dependencies if the shortcode is used. To do so correctly the theme adds management code in various files.\nYou can you use this mechanism in your own shortcodes. Say you want to add a shortcode myshortcode that also requires the jquery JavaScript library.\nWrite the shortcode file layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html and add the following line\n​ layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html {{- .Page.Store.Set \"hasMyShortcode\" true }} Add the following snippet to your hugo.toml\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] [params.relearn] [params.relearn.dependencies] [params.relearn.dependencies.myshortcode] name = 'MyShortcode' params: relearn: dependencies: myshortcode: name: MyShortcode { \"params\": { \"relearn\": { \"dependencies\": { \"myshortcode\": { \"name\": \"MyShortcode\" } } } } } Add the dependency loader file layouts/partials/dependencies/myshortcode.html. The loader file will be called from multiple locations inside of the theme with the parameter page containing the current page variable and location with one of the currently defined locations\nheader: if called at the end of the HTML head element footer: if called at the end of the HTML body element ​ layouts/partials/dependencies/myshortcode.html {{- if eq .location \"footer\" }} \u003cscript src=\"https://www.unpkg.com/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e {{- end }} Character casing is relevant!\nthe name setting in your hugo.toml must match the key (that needs to be prefixed with a has) you used for the store in your layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html. the key on params.relearn.dependencies in your hugo.toml must match the base file name of your loader file. See the math, mermaid and openapi shortcodes for examples.\nNote If you are really into customization of the theme and want to use the dependency loader for your own locations, you can do this by simply calling it from inside of your overriden partials\n{{- partial \"dependencies.html\" (dict \"page\" . \"location\" \"mylocation\") }} Output Formats Certain parts of the theme can be changed for support of your own output formats. Eg. if you define a new output format PLAINTEXT in your hugo.toml, you can add a file layouts/partials/header.plaintext.html to change the way, the page header should look like for that output format.\nReact to Variant Switches in JavaScript Once a color variant is fully loaded, either initially or by switching the color variant manually with the variant selector, the custom event themeVariantLoaded on the document will be dispatched. You can add an event listener and react to changes.\ndocument.addEventListener( 'themeVariantLoaded', function( e ){ console.log( e.detail.variant ); // `relearn-light` });Partials The Relearn theme has been built to be as configurable as possible by defining multiple partials\nIn themes/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/partials/, you will find all the partials defined for this theme. If you need to overwrite something, don’t change the code directly. Instead follow this page. You’d create a new partial in the layouts/partials folder of your local project. This partial will have the priority.\nThis theme defines the following partials :\nheader.html: the header of the page. See output-formats footer.html: the footer of the page. See output-formats body.html: the body of the page. The body may contain of one or many articles. See output-formats article.html: the output for a single article, can contain elements around your content. See output-formats menu.html: left menu. Not meant to be overwritten search.html: search box. Not meant to be overwritten custom-header.html: custom headers in page. Meant to be overwritten when adding CSS imports. Don’t forget to include style HTML tag directive in your file. custom-footer.html: custom footer in page. Meant to be overwritten when adding JavaScript. Don’t forget to include javascript HTML tag directive in your file. favicon.html: the favicon heading.html: side-wide configuration to change the pages title headings. heading-pre.html: side-wide configuration to prepend to pages title headings. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s headingPre setting into account. heading-post.html: side-wide configuration to append to pages title headings. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s headingPost setting into account. logo.html: the logo, on top left hand corner meta.html: HTML meta tags, if you want to change default behavior menu-pre.html: side-wide configuration to prepend to menu items. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s menuPre setting into account. menu-post.html: side-wide configuration to append to menu items. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s menuPost setting into account. menu-footer.html: footer of the left menu toc.html: table of contents content.html: the content page itself. This can be overridden if you want to display page’s meta data above or below the content. content-header.html: header above the title, has a default implementation but you can overwrite it if you don’t like it. content-footer.html: footer below the content, has a default implementation but you can overwrite it if you don’t like it.

    "content": "The theme comes with a reasonably configured topbar.\nNevertheless, your requirements may differ from this configuration. Luckily the theme got you covered as the themebar, its buttons and the functionality behind these buttons is fully configurable by you.\nTip All mentioned file names below can be clicked and show you the implementation for a better understanding.\nAreas The default configuration comes with three predefined areas that may contain an arbitrary set of buttons.\nstart: shown between menu and breadcrumb end: shown on the opposite breadcrumb side in comparison to the start area more: shown when pressing the more button in the topbar While you can not add additional areas in the topbar, you are free to configure additional buttons that behave like the more button, providing further user defined areas.\nButtons The theme ships with the following predefined buttons (from left to right in the screenshot)\nsidebar: opens the sidebar flyout if in mobile layout toc: opens the table of contents in an overlay edit: browses to the editable page if the editURL parameter is set print: browses to the chapters printable page if print support was activated prev: browses to the previous page if there is one next: browses to the next page if there is one more: opens the overlay for the more area Not all buttons are displayed at every given time. This is configurable (see below if interested).\nRedefining Areas Each predefined area and button comes in their own file. By that it is easy for you to overwrite an area file in your installation reusing only the buttons you like.\nEg. you can redefine the predefined end area by adding the file layouts/partials/topbar/area/end.html in your installation (not in the theme itself) to remove all but the more button.\nThe below example sets an explicit value for the onempty parameter, overriding the specific default value for this button (these defaults vary depending on the button). The parameter causes the more button to always be displayed instead of hiding once its content is empty.\n{{ partial \"topbar/button/more.html\" (dict \"page\" . \"onempty\" \"disable\" )}}Defining own Buttons Button Types The theme distinguishes between two types of buttons:\nbutton: a clickable button that either browses to another site, triggers a user defined script or opens an overlay containing user defined content area-button: the template for the more button, to define your own area overlay buttons Button Parameter Screen Widths and Actions Depending on the screen width you can configure how the button should behave. Screen width is divided into three classes:\ns: (controlled by the onwidths parameter) mobile layout where the menu sidebar is hidden m: (controlled by the onwidthm parameter) desktop layout with visible sidebar while the content area width still resizes l: (controlled by the onwidthl parameter) desktop layout with visible sidebar once the content area reached its maximum width For each width class, you can configure one of the following actions:\nshow: the button is displayed in its given area hide: the button is removed area-XXX: the button is moved from its given area into the area XXX; eg. this is used to move buttons to the more area overlay in the mobile layout Hiding and Disabling Stuff While hiding a button depending on the screen size can be configured with the above described hide action, you may want to hide the button on certain other conditions as well.\nFor example, the print button in its default configuration should only be displayed if print support was configured. This is done in your button template by checking the conditions first before displaying the button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/print.html).\nAnother preferred condition for hiding a button is, if the displayed overlay is empty. This is the case for the toc (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/toc.html) as well as the more button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/more.html) and controlled by the parameter onempty.\nThis parameter can have one of the following values:\ndisable: the button displayed in disabled state if the overlay is empty hide: the button is removed if the overlay is empty If you want to disable a button containing no overlay, this can be achieved by an empty href parameter. An example can be seen in the prev button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/prev.html) where the URL for the previous site may be empty.\nReference Button Contains the basic button functionality and is used as a base implementation for all other buttons (layouts/partials/topbar/func/button.html).\nCall this from your own button templates if you want to implement a button without an overlay like the print button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/print.html) or with an overlay containing arbitrary content like the toc button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/toc.html).\nFor displaying an area in the button’s overlay, see Area-Button.\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. class \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory unique class name for this button. Displaying two buttons with the same value for class is undefined. href \u003cempty\u003e Either the destination URL for the button or JavaScript code to be executed on click.\n- if starting with javascript: all following text will be executed in your browser\n- every other string will be interpreted as URL\n- if empty the button will be displayed in disabled state regardless of its content icon \u003cempty\u003e Font Awesome icon name. onempty disable Defines what to do with the button if the content parameter was set but ends up empty:\n- disable: The button is displayed in disabled state.\n- hide: The button is removed. onwidths show The action, that should be executed if the site is displayed in the given width:\n- show: The button is displayed in its given area\n- hide: The button is removed.\n- area-XXX: The button is moved from its given area into the area XXX. onwidthm show See above. onwidthl show See above. hint \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary text displayed in the tooltip. title \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary text for the button. content \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary HTML to put into the content overlay. This parameter may be empty. In this case no overlay will be generated. Area-Button Contains the basic functionality to display area overlay buttons (layouts/partials/topbar/func/area-button.html).\nCall this from your own button templates if you want to implement a button with an area overlay like the more button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/more.html).\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. area \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory unique area name for this area.

Predefined Buttons The predefined buttons by the theme (all other buttons besides the more and toc button in layouts/partials/topbar/button).\nCall these from your own redefined area templates if you want to use default button behavior.\nThe \u003cvarying\u003e parameter values are different for each button and configured for standard behavior as seen on this page.\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. onwidths \u003cvarying\u003e The action, that should be executed if the site is displayed in the given width:\n- show: The button is displayed in its given area\n- hide: The button is removed.\n- area-XXX: The button is moved from its given area into the area XXX. onwidthm \u003cvarying\u003e See above. onwidthl \u003cvarying\u003e See above.

This needs to be assigned latest before release.\nLabel Description Changelog section documentation Improvements or additions to documentation - discussion This issue was converted to a discussion - task Maintenance work Maintenance feature New feature or request Features bug Something isn’t working Fixes Impact If the issue would cause a new main release due to semver semantics it needs one of the according labels and the matching badge on the What’s new page.\nLabel Description change Introduces changes with existing installations breaking Introduces breaking changes with existing installations Declination If an issue does not result in changesets but is closed anyways, it must have exactly one of the following labels.\nLabel Description duplicate This issue or pull request already exists invalid This doesn’t seem right support Request for achieving a special goal unresolved No progress on this issue update A change in behavior after updat wontchange This will not be worked on Halt You can assign one further label out of the following list to signal readers that development on an open issue is currently halted for different reasons.\nLabel Description blocked Depends on other issue to be fixed first idea A valuable idea that’s currently not worked on undecided No decision was made yet helpwanted Great idea, send in a PR needsfeedback Further information is needed 3rd-Party If the issue is not caused by a programming error in the themes own code, you can label the causing program or library.\nLabel Description asciidoc This is a topic related to processing of AsciiDoc browser This is a topic related to the browser but not the theme device This is a topic related to a certain device hugo This is a topic related to Hugo itself but not the theme mermaid This is a topic related to Mermaid itself but not the theme Making Releases A release is based on a milestone named like the release itself - just the version number, eg: 1.2.3. It’s in the maintainers responsibility to check semver semantics of the milestone’s name prior to release and change it if necessary.\nMaking releases is automated by the version-release GitHub Action. It requires the version number of the milestone that should be released. The release will be created from the main branch of the repository.\nTreat released milestones as immutable. Don’t rerelease an already released milestone. An already released milestone may already been consumed by your users.\nDuring execution of the action a few things are checked. If a check fails the action fails, resulting in no new release. You can correct the errors afterwards and rerun the action.\nThe following checks will be enforced\nthe milestone exists there is at least one closed issue assigned to the milestone all assigned issues for this milestone are closed if it’s a main release, there must be a new \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e at the beginning of the What’s new page if it’s a patch release, there must be the \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e from the previous release at the beginning of the What’s new page After a successful run of the action\nthe History page is updated, including release version, release date and text the What’s new page is updated, including release version, release date and text the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated the updated files are committed the milestone is closed the repository is tagged with the version number (eg. 1.2.3), the main version number (eg. 1.2.x) and the major version number (eg. 1.x) a new entry in the GitHub release list with the according changelog will be created the official documentation is built and deployed the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated to a temporary and committed (this helps to determine if users are running directly on the main branch or are using releases) a new milestone for the next patch release is created (this can later be renamed to a main release if necessary) ",

Configuration MathJax is configured with default settings but you can customize MathJax’s default settings for all of your files through a JSON object in your hugo.toml or override these settings per page through your pages frontmatter.\nThe JSON object of your hugo.toml / frontmatter is forwarded into MathJax’s configuration object.\nSee MathJax documentation for all allowed settings.\nGlobal Configuration File This example reflects the default configuration also used if you don’t define mathJaxInitialize\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] mathJaxInitialize = '{ \"tex\": { \"inlineMath\": [[\"\\(\", \"\\)\"], [\"$\", \"$\"]], displayMath: [[\"\\[\", \"\\]\"], [\"$$\", \"$$\"]] }, \"options\": { \"enableMenu\": false }' params: mathJaxInitialize: '{ \"tex\": { \"inlineMath\": [[\"\\(\", \"\\)\"], [\"$\", \"$\"]], displayMath: [[\"\\[\", \"\\]\"], [\"$$\", \"$$\"]] }, \"options\": { \"enableMenu\": false }' { \"params\": { \"mathJaxInitialize\": \"{ \\\"tex\\\": { \\\"inlineMath\\\": [[\\\"\\\\(\\\", \\\"\\\\)\\\"], [\\\"$\\\", \\\"$\\\"]], displayMath: [[\\\"\\\\[\\\", \\\"\\\\]\\\"], [\\\"$$\\\", \\\"$$\\\"]] }, \\\"options\\\": { \\\"enableMenu\\\": false }\" } } Page’s Frontmatter Usually you don’t need to redefine the global initialization settings for a single page. But if you do, you have repeat all the values from your global configuration you want to keep for a single page as well.\nEg. If you have redefined the delimiters to something exotic like @ symbols in your global config, but want to additionally align your math to the left for a specific page, you have to put this to your frontmatter:\n​ toml yaml json +++ mathJaxInitialize = '{ \"chtml\": { \"displayAlign\": \"left\" }, { \"tex\": { \"inlineMath\": [[\"\\(\", \"\\)\"], [\"@\", \"@\"]], displayMath: [[\"\\[\", \"\\]\"], [\"@@\", \"@@\"]] }, \"options\": { \"enableMenu\": false }' +++ --- mathJaxInitialize: '{ \"chtml\": { \"displayAlign\": \"left\" }, { \"tex\": { \"inlineMath\": [[\"\\(\", \"\\)\"], [\"@\", \"@\"]], displayMath: [[\"\\[\", \"\\]\"], [\"@@\", \"@@\"]] }, \"options\": { \"enableMenu\": false }' --- { \"mathJaxInitialize\": \"{ \\\"chtml\\\": { \\\"displayAlign\\\": \\\"left\\\" }, { \\\"tex\\\": { \\\"inlineMath\\\": [[\\\"\\\\(\\\", \\\"\\\\)\\\"], [\\\"@\\\", \\\"@\\\"]], displayMath: [[\\\"\\\\[\\\", \\\"\\\\]\\\"], [\\\"@@\\\", \\\"@@\\\"]] }, \\\"options\\\": { \\\"enableMenu\\\": false }\" } Passthrough Configuration You can use your math without enclosing it in a shortcode or codefence by using a passthrough configuration in your hugo.toml:\nhugo. toml yaml json [markup] [markup.goldmark] [markup.goldmark.extensions] [markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough] enable = true [markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough.delimiters] block = [['\\[', '\\]'], ['$$', '$$']] inline = [['\\(', '\\)'], ['$', '$']] markup: goldmark: extensions: passthrough: delimiters: block: - - \\[ - \\] - - $$ - $$ inline: - - \\( - \\) - - $ - $ enable: true { \"markup\": { \"goldmark\": { \"extensions\": { \"passthrough\": { \"delimiters\": { \"block\": [ [ \"\\\\[\", \"\\\\]\" ], [ \"$$\", \"$$\" ] ], \"inline\": [ [ \"\\\\(\", \"\\\\)\" ], [ \"$\", \"$\" ] ] }, \"enable\": true } } } } } In this case you have to tell the theme that your page contains math by setting this in your page’s frontmatter:\n​ toml yaml json +++ disableMathJax = false +++ --- disableMathJax: false --- { \"disableMathJax\": false } See the example on how it makes using math really easy.\nExamples Inline Math Inline math is generated if you use a single `$` as a delimiter around your formulae: {{\u003c math \u003e}}$\\sqrt{3}${{\u003c /math \u003e}}Inline math is generated if you use a single $ as a delimiter around your formulae: $\\sqrt{3}$\nBlocklevel Math with Right Alignment If you delimit your formulae by two consecutive `$$` it generates a new block. {{\u003c math align=\"right\" \u003e}} $$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$ {{\u003c /math \u003e}}If you delimit your formulae by two consecutive $$ it generates a new block.\n$$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$ Codefence You can also use codefences.\n```math $$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$ ``` $$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$Passthrough This works for block as well as inline math but is only available if you are using the passthrough configuration.\nWith passthrough configuration you can just drop your math without enclosed by shortcodes or codefences but no settings from the parameter table are available.\n$$\\left| \\begin{array}{cc} a \u0026 b \\\\ c \u0026 d \\end{array}\\right|$$$$\\left| \\begin{array}{cc} a \u0026 b \\\\ c \u0026 d \\end{array}\\right|$$ Chemical Formulae {{\u003c math \u003e}} $$\\ce{Hg^2+ -\u003e[I-] HgI2 -\u003e[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-}$$ {{\u003c /math \u003e}} $$\\ce{Hg^2+ -\u003e[I-] HgI2 -\u003e[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-}$$ ",

Can be overridden by each tab. See the tab shortcode for possible values. color \u003cempty\u003e Sets a default value for every contained tab. Can be overridden by each tab.
