    "content": "5.27.0 (2024-04-07) Hugo 0.121.0 0.121.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Change Change If the theme is configured to generate warnings or errors during build by setting image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml, it will now also generate output if a link fragment is not found in the target page.\nChange The dependency loader was made more versatile.\nThe configuration in your hugo.toml does not require the location parameter anymore. If you still use it, the theme will work as before but will generate a warning. So you don’t need to change anything, yet.\nWith the new mechanism, your dependency loader now receives an additional location parameter instead that you can query to inject your dependencies in the desired location.\nBy that you can now call the dependency mechanism in your own overriden partials by giving it a distinct location parameter. In addition your injected files can now be spread to multiple locations which wasn’t previously possible.\nNew New Additional styling was added for the native HTML elements \u003cmark\u003e and \u003ckbd\u003e. To use them you must allow the usage of HTML in your hugo.toml. The Markdown documentation was enhanced for this.\nNew You now can scroll forward and backward through all headings of a page by using ALT 🡑 and ALT 🡓. This also works for the PRINT output format.\nNew The breadcrumbs used in the topbar, search results and the taxonomy term lists are now using the pages front matter linktitle instead of title if set.",

You don’t need to change anything as the old menuTitle option is still supported.\nChange The light themes have a bit more contrast for content text and headings. Also the syntaxhighlighting was changed to the more colorful MonokaiLight. This brings the syntaxhighlighting in sync with the corresponding dark theme variants, which are using Monokai. If you dislike this, you can create your own color variant file as described here.\nNew New If the theme can not resolve a link to a page or image, you can now generate warnings or errors during build by setting link.errorlevel or image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml respectively. By default this condition is silently ignored and the link is written as-is.\nPlease note that a page link will generate false negatives if uglyURLs=true and it references an ordinary page before 0.123.0.\nPlease note that an image link will generate false negatives if the file resides in your static directory.\nNew You now can configure additional options for every theme variant in your hugo.toml. This allows for optional advanced functionality. You don’t need to change anything as the old configuration options will still work (but may generate warnings now).\nThe advanced functionality allows you to set an explicit name for a theme variant and now allows for multiple auto mode variants that adjust to the light/dark preference of your OS settings.\nNew New partial for defining the heading. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Support for Hugo’s built-in figure shortcode.\nNew On taxonomy and term pages you can now use prev/next navigation as within the normal page structure.\nNew In additiion to the existing menu width customization, it is now also possible to set the width of the menu flyout for small screen sizes with the --MENU-WIDTH-S CSS property.\nNew Improvements for accessibility when tabbing through the page for images, links and tab handles.\nNew The editURL config parameter is now overwritable in your pages front matter. In addition it received more versatility by letting you control where to put the file path into the URL. This is achieved by replacing the variable ${FilePath} in your URL by the pages file path. You don’t need to change anything in your existing configuration as the old way without the replacement variable still works.\nNew The themes config and front matter options received a comprehensive documentation update. In addition the theme switched from config.toml to hugo.toml.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.121.0 or higher for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.123.0 or higher for theme specific output formats and handling of taxonomy and term titles.

If this gets too crowded for you, you can turn the breadcrumbs off in your hugo.toml by adding disableTermBreadcrumbs=true.\nNew New Taxonomy and term pages are now allowed to contain content. This is added inbetween the title and the page list.\nNew It is now possible to print custom taxonomies anywhere in your page. See the docs.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the menu width for your whole site. See the docs.\nNew This release adds social media meta tags for the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Cards to your site. See the docs.\nNew This release comes with additional sort options for the menu and the children shortcode. Both will now accept the following values: weight, title, linktitle, modifieddate, expirydate, publishdate, date, length or default (adhering to Hugo’s default sort order).\nNew The theme now provides a mechanism to load further JavaScript dependencies defined by you only if it is needed. This comes in handy if you want to add own shortcodes that depend on additional JavaScript code to be loaded. See the docs.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for the xychart type.\nNew This release adds portable Markdown links.\nPreviously it was not possible to use pure Markdown links in a configuration independent way to link to pages inside of your project. It always required you to know how your uglyURLs setting is, wheather you link to a page or page bundle and in case of relative links if your current page is a page or page bundle. (eg. [generator](generator/index.html) vs. [generator](generator.html)). This is a hassle as you have to change these links manually once you change your uglyURLs setting or change the type of a page.\nYou could work around this by using the relref shortcode (eg [generator]({{% relref \"../generator\" %}})) which works but results in non-portable Markdown.\nNow it’s possible to use the same path of a call to relref in a plain Markdown link (eg [generator](../generator)). This is independent of any configuration settings or the page types involved in linking. Note, that this requires your links to be given without any extension, so [generator](generator/index.html) will work as before.\nThe following types of linking are supported:\nlink description [generator](en/configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](/en/configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](/configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](./../generator) relative from the current page [generator](../generator) relative from the current page",

See the documentation for how to do this.\nThis feature may require you to make changes to your existing installation if you are already using shortcuts to pages inside of your project with a headless branch parent.\nIn this case it is advised to remove the title from the headless branch parent’s front matter, as it will otherwise appear in your breadcrumbs.\nNew New It is now possible to overwrite the setting for collapsibleMenu of your hugo.toml inside of a page’s front matter.\nNew If a Mermaid graph is zoomable a button to reset the view is now added to the upper right corner. The button is only shown once the mouse is moved over the graph.\nNew It is now possible to remove the root breadcrumb by setting disableRootBreadcrumb=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew The output of the dedicated search page now displays the result’s breadcrumb.\nNew Table rows now change their background color on every even row.\nNew Translation into Swahili. This language is not supported for search.",

If you have self-defined taxonomies, you can add translations by adding them to your own i18n files. If you don’t provide translations, the singualar and plural forms are taken as configured in your hugo.toml.\nNew To give you more flexibility in customizing your article layout a new partial content-header.html is introduced.\nThis came out of the requirement to customize the position of article tags, which by default are displayed above the title. A second requirement was to also show additional taxonomies not supported by the theme natively. While Hugo supports tags and categories by default, the theme only displays tags.\nSo how to adjust the position of tags starting from the theme’s default where tags are only shown above the title?\nHide tags above title: Overwrite content-header.html with an empty file. Show tags between title and content: Overwrite heading-post.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. Show tags below content: Overwrite content-footer.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it.

    "content": "2.9.0 (2021-11-19) Breaking Breaking This release removes the themes implementation of ref/relref in favor for Hugo’s standard implementation. This is because of inconsistencies with the themes implementation. In advantage, your project becomes standard compliant and exchanging this theme in your project to some other theme will be effortless.\nIn a standard compliant form you must not link to the *.md file but to its logical name. You’ll see, referencing other pages becomes much easier. All three types result in the same reference:\nType Non-Standard Standard Branch bundle configuration/reference/_index.md configuration/reference Leaf bundle configuration/reference/index.md configuration/reference Page configuration/reference.md configuration/reference If you’ve linked from a page of one language to a page of another language, conversion is a bit more difficult but Hugo got you covered as well.\nAlso, the old themes implementation allowed refs to non-existing content. This will cause Hugo’s implementation to show the error below and abort the generation. If your project relies on this old behavior, you can reconfigure the error handling of Hugo’s implementation.\nIn the best case your usage of the old implementation is already standard compliant and you don’t need to change anything. You’ll notice this very easily once you’ve started hugo server after an upgrade and no errors are written to the console.\nYou may see errors on the console after the update in the form:\nERROR 2021/11/19 22:29:10 [en] REF_NOT_FOUND: Ref \"configuration/reference/_index.md\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\\exampleSite\\content\\_index.en.md:19:22\": page not found In this case, you must apply one of two options:\nStart up a text editor with regular expression support for search and replace. Search for (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*?)(?:/_index|/index)?(?:\\.md)?(#[^\"]*?)?\" and replace it by $1$2\" in all *.md files. This is the recommended choice.\nCopy the old implementation files theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/ref.html and theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/relref.html to your own projects layouts/shortcode/ref.html and layouts/shortcode/relref.html respectively. This is not recommended as your project will still rely on non-standard behavior afterwards.",

This causes its content to not be ontained in the sitemap.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'Showcase' [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = true render = 'always' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: true render: always title: Showcase --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": true, \"render\": \"always\" }, \"title\": \"Showcase\" } Store the page file for below a parent headless branch bundle and add the following front matter to he parent (see exampleSite’s content/more/_index.en.md). Don’t give this page a title as this will cause it to be shown in the breadcrumbs - a thing you most likely don’t want.\n​ toml yaml json +++ [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = false render = 'never' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: false render: never --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": false, \"render\": \"never\" } } In this case, the file itself can be a branch bundle, leaf bundle or simple page (see exampleSite’s content/more/credits.en.md). This causes its content to be contained in the sitemap.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'Credits' +++ --- title: Credits --- { \"title\": \"Credits\" } Change Change The required directory name for the attachments shortcode was changed for leaf bundles.\nPreviously, the attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups were required to be in a files subdirectory. For page bundles and leaf bundles in multilang setups they were always required to be in a _index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files or index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files subdirectory accordingly.\nThis added unnecessary complexity. So attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups can now also reside in a index.files directory. Although the old files directory is now deprecated, if both directories are present, only the old files directory will be used for compatibility.\nChange Absolute links prefixed with http:// or https:// are now opened in a separate browser tab.\nYou can revert back to the old behavior by defining externalLinkTarget=\"_self\" in the params section of your hugo.toml.\nNew New The theme now supports Hugo’s module system.",

    "content": "7.3.0 (2025-01-03) New New Support for Hugo’s built-in details shortcode by mapping it to the theme’s expand shortcode.\nNew The topbar button for the print format can now be hidden if the print output format is active by setting disablePrintButton=true in your hugo.toml or Front Matter.\nNew The theme supports the new markdown output format which behaves similar in configuration as the print output format but allows the original Markdown source of a page to be viewed.\nYou can see this in action on the above linked page, accessible by clikcking the topbar button.\nNew Keyboard support for code blocks was improved so the copy to clipboard button is now reachable by TAB if disableHoverBlockCopyToClipBoard=false was set in the hugo.toml.\nNew Futher accessibility impovements were made for the anchor, copy to clipboard and mermaid reset functionality by using a HTML button instead of a span.\n7.2.0 (2024-12-10) Change Change The expand shortcode was refactored and now internally uses the notice shortcode.\nDue to these changes, expand and notice with style=transparent will now generate slightly different margins.\nChange This release fixes a long standing issue, where loading a page with a non-default variant may caused screen flashing.\nFixing this resulted in major changes how stylesheets are bundled during built and ultimately leads to different stylesheets been loaded in the browser. If you haven’t done any undocumented stuff with the stylesheets, this change should not have any negative effects to your site.\nAnyways, please note that now the variant generator is not included in the theme release anymore but is only available in the exampleSite docs. As a sideeffect, less JavaScript will be loaded on your site.\nNew New As a fallout of fixing the flashing issue, you can now minify the bundled stylesheets by setting the minify parameter in your hugo.toml. Without configuring this parameter, the theme will minify the stylesheets for production (hugo) but not for development (hugo server).\nNew The notice shortcode was improved for accessibility and comes with a brand new parameter groupid.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 11.4.1. This adds support for Kanban diagrams.\nNew Translation into Persian. This language is not supported for search.\n7.1.0 (2024-10-25) Change Change The sidebar menus are now completely configurable.\nThis is provided by the new parameter sidebarmenus. With the new system, you can\nshow arbitrary amounts of menus set headings for each menu base it on your page structure or use Hugo’s menu feature configure a starting page if a menu is based on page structure display unlimited nesting for both menu types reconfigure the menus in a page’s front matter apply the usual parameter alwaysopen, collapsibleMenu, etc. for all menu types You don’t need to change anything in your existing installation as the old configuration is used as a default.\nChange The children shortcode was changed to output a page’s LinkTitle instead of previously using the Title.\nAs the shortcode always outputs subpages in context of the parent page, it functions similar to the sidebar menu. The sidebar menu itself uses the LinkTitle for naming the menu entries and so should the shortcode do.\nThe parameter value sort=linktitle was deprecated for the easier sort=title. You can still use the old value but both behave the same way in sorting by LinkTitle.\nNew New Menus created by your page structure are now able to contain arbitrary links inserted into the structure using the menuUrl or menuPageRef front matter. 7.0.0 (2024-10-15) Hugo 0.126.0 0.126.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Breaking Breaking This release comes with significant changes in file naming of partials and how the theme works internally. This was done because the theme\nsuffered from poor build performance for sites with 1000 or more pages reinvented the wheel instead of using available Hugo mechanisms What do I gain, you may ask. A significant performance boost during build! Usually, the build time has been cut at least in half for bigger sites. It is now possible to build even larger sites with 5000 or more pages. This was previously almost impossible due to rapidly increasing build time with the more pages you’ve introduced. For even bigger sites, the theme now has configurable performance optimizations - at the price of feature limitations.\nIf you haven’t done customizations to any partials, you can update right away.\nIf you have customized your templates, in the best cases, you will get build warnings or even errors. In the worst cases, your build succeeds but the site will not work as intended by you.\nSpecifically, you will have to adapt your site if you have\nself-defined output formats self-defined archetypes - now becoming page designs and using Hugo’s content view mechanism overwritten the header.html, menu.html or footer.html partials - needs sync with implementation changes overwritten prev/next topbar buttons - needs sync with implementation changes Breaking This release changes the way the search index and the dedicated search page are generated. This may require reconfiguration by you to still work as you have intended.\nRemove the now obsolete search and searchpage output format from [outputs.home] in your hugo.toml, resulting in something similar to\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'print'] outputs: home: - html - rss - print { \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ] } } After that, your build will succeed but will may cause new defaults to be applied. With no further settings, in-page search, search popup and dedicated search page are all active by default. This can be reconfigured.\nIn addition, you are now able to overwrite the default file name of the search index and the default page name of the dedicated search page by changing searchIndexURL and searchPageURL respectively in your hugo.toml.\nChange Change Once again, the theme changed the font. We switched to the excellent Roboto Flex font.\nCare was taken to configure the font to look similar to the previously used Work Sans. Nevertheless, in direct comparison, you will see slight differences in appearance.\nThis change was necessary as the previously used font had display issues with marked text, contrast, and some other minor stuff. As an aftermath, the number of requests and the download size were decreased when loading a page.\nThe font was created by Google, is licensed under OFL 1.1 and is delivered from your theme’s installation. As always, no third-party server calls are involved.\nIf you have changed the font-family in your installation, you most likely have to adjust the variables --MAIN-font-weight, --MAIN-BOLD-font-weight and --MAIN-letter-spacing.\nAdditionally, if you have changed the font to a variable font in your installation, you may have to adjust the variable --MAIN-font-variation-settings. As this only applies to variable fonts, this should rarely be necessary.\nChange While switching the font, it was discovered that certain CSS variables were falsely named. You don’t need to change anything in your custom variant stylesheet as the old names will be used as a fallback.\n--MAIN-TITLES-TEXT-font was renamed to --MAIN-TITLES-font, --MAIN-TITLES-H\u003cn\u003e-color was renamed to --MAIN-TITLES-H\u003cn\u003e-TEXT-color.\nChange The options and front matter to force loading a math, mermaid or openapi library has been changed.\nPreviously, you had to set the unintuitive disableMathJax=false to force load the math library in case of a passthrough configuration. This is replaced by the simpler math=true or math.force=true and is now in line with Hugo’s official documentation.\nYou don’t need to change anything yet but will receive warnings if the old settings are used.\nChange The default logo is not contained inside of the theme’s logo partial anymore.\nThis is to avoid usage of the theme’s branding throughout the web in non-modified installations.\nIn addition, the default text for the logo partial is now taken from the linkTitle setting of your hugo.toml.\nNew New The docs received a much-needed overhaul for all chapters.\nBasically, the structure was reorganized, giving each topic its own page while keeping the amount of items for each menu level comprehensible by adding sub-pages.\nThe docs now clearly differentiate between configuration of your site, all things writing page content and the shortcodes docs that cover both topics, configuration and usage.\nTo give you a better overview of what’s possible with the theme, we introduced reference pages for all theme configuration options and front matter and mark each occurrence of such on all pages with the badges Option and Front Matter.\nAlso, a lot of previously undocumented features are now included, namely\nthe hidden pages feature options of the menus configuring breadcrumb, titles and headings of your content options for using links adding custom output formats",

On this page, displayed search results have more space making it easier scanning through large number of results.\nTo activate this feature, you need to configure it in your hugo.toml as a new outputformat searchpage for the home page. If you don’t configure it, no dedicated search page will be accessible and the theme works as before.\nYou can access the search page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or pressing enter inside of the search box.\nNew Keyboard handling for the TOC and search was improved.\nPressing CTRL+ALT+t now will not only toggle the TOC overlay but also places the focus to the first heading on opening. Subsequently this makes it possible to easily select headings by using the TAB key.\nThe search received its own brand new keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+f. This will focus the cursor inside of the search box so you can immediately start your search by typing.\nNew You are now able to turn off the generation of generator meta tags in your HTML head to hide the used versions of Hugo and this theme.\nTo configure this in your hugo.toml make sure to set Hugo’s disableHugoGeneratorInject=true and also [params] disableGeneratorVersion=true, otherwise Hugo will generate a meta tag into your home page automagically.\nNew Creation of your project gets a little bit faster with this release.\nThis addresses increased build time with the version 5 releases. The theme now heavily caches partial results leading to improved performance. To further increase performance, unnecessary parts of the page are now skipped for creation of the print output (eg. menus, navigation bar, etc.).",

    "content": "6.4.0 (2024-10-11) Change Change If you now display a single code block in a notice box, its margin and border will be removed so only the colored notice border is visible. New New It is now possible to have user-defined styles for all shortcodes that accept the style parameter. See the notice shortcode for configuration.\nNew The resources shortcode has a new parameter expanded to make the resource list collapsible.\n6.3.0 (2024-09-03) Change Change The expand shortcode changed the naming of the open parameter to expanded. You don’t need to change anything yet but may get deprecation warnings.\nChange If the content for the notice shortcode is empty, now only the title bar will be displayed. Previously an empty content box was displayed.\nNew New The notice shortcode has a new parameter expanded to make the content collapsible.\nNew If you are running Hugo 0.134.0 or later, the theme now supports Obsidian callouts.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 11.1.0. This adds support for packet and architecture diagrams.\n6.2.0 (2024-08-26) Change Change The heading anchor links are extended in functionality.\nIf you now click on it, not only is the link copied to the clipboard (previous behavior) but also the heading scrolls to the top of the page.\nIf you dislike the new behavior, you can deactivate it by setting disableAnchorScrolling=true in your hugo.toml. See the docs for further options.\nNew New If you are running Hugo 0.132.0 or later, the theme is now capable to print GitHub alerts.\nNew To support new severity levels for GitHub alerts, all shortcodes that support severity levels with their style parameter were expanded with the new severities caution and important and the color parameter was expanded with cyan and magenta. Please note, that coloring and icons of severities may defer from the display you see on GitHub.\nNew To support new severity levels for GitHub alerts, the new severities and their according colors are also available as CSS variables BOX-MAGENTA-color, BOX-MAGENTA-TEXT-color, BOX-CAUTION-color, BOX-CAUTION-TEXT-color, BOX-CYAN-color, BOX-CYAN-TEXT-color, BOX-IMPORTANT-color, BOX-IMPORTANT-TEXT-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as appropriate default colors will be used.\n6.1.0 (2024-08-02) Change Change The include shortcode is now able to resolve links to pages as well as resources or files in the file system (the old behavior).\nChange To make the asset buster mechanism more robust, some internally used stylesheets where restructured. This generally should not affect your page in any negative way.\nNew New The openapi shortcode is now able to resolve links to resources as well as to files in the file system (the old behavior). You can configure to generate warnings or errors during build by setting openapi.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml if a path can not be resolved.\nNew Shortcodes supporting an errorlevel configuration can now have overridden values in the front matter section of each individual page.\nNew The theme now comes with its own overridden version of the relref shortcode.\nWhile the usage of relref is obsolete and discouraged by Hugo for a while, existing installations may use it. In configurations using a baseURL with a subdirectory, and having relativeURLs=false (the default) Hugo’s standard relref implementation was failing.\nThe shortcode is deactivated by default and can be activated by setting\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] disableDefaultRelref = true params: disableDefaultRelref: true { \"params\": { \"disableDefaultRelref\": true } } in your hugo.toml. Only do this if your site fulfills all of the above assumptions.\n6.0.0 (2024-04-27) Breaking Breaking This release requires you to move your self-defined variant (theme-*.css) and chroma stylesheets (chroma-*.css) from static/css to assets/css.\nThis was necessary to avoid permission errors on build if running in certain Unix configurations.\nIn addition it is not allowed anymore to @import your chroma stylesheet from inside of your variant stylesheet.\nSay, your chroma stylesheet is named chroma-monokai.css, you have to add the following inside your variant stylesheet:\n--CODE-theme: monokai; Breaking The parameter description in your hugo.toml will now be ignored.\nWith the newly introduced unified handling of descriptions throughout the theme, the only place the old parameter would have been used was your home page.\nFor migration, move the description parameter of your hugo.toml into the front matter section of your home page.\nBreaking Search support for the json outputformat deprecated in 5.4.0 was removed.\nChange it to search for the homepage in your hugo.toml. See the docs for detailed configuration.\nBreaking The front matter option menuTitle deprecated in 5.24.0 was removed in favor for Hugo’s own linkTitle.\nAdditionally, if set, linkTitle will now be used instead of title to generate the breadcrumb.\nBreaking The swagger shortcode deprecated in 5.13.0 was removed in favor for the openapi shortcode with the same set of parameter.\nBreaking Support for Internet Explorer 11 was finally dropped.\nChange Change With the removal of support for Internet Explorer 11, Font Awesome was upgraded to version 6.5.2.\nYou may experience slight changes for some icons. In addition you have additional ~1700 icons to chose from.\nChange The children shortcode was fixed to adhere to its documentation, generating the description based on this rule: When no description or summary exists for the page, the first 70 words of the content is taken.\nPreviously, the summary erroneously was ignored which now can lead to different output if you set description=true as a parameter.\nNew New The include shortcode is now able to resolve links to resources as well as to files in the file system (the old behavior). You can configure to generate warnings or errors during build by setting include.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml if a path can not be resolved.\nNew Math is now usable without enclosing it in a shortcode or Markdown codefence by using Hugo’s passthrough configuration.\nNew Translation into Romanian.",

    "content": "5.27.0 (2024-04-07) Hugo 0.121.0 0.121.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Change Change If the theme is configured to generate warnings or errors during build by setting image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml, it will now also generate output if a link fragment is not found in the target page.\nChange The dependency loader was made more versatile.\nThe configuration in your hugo.toml does not require the location parameter anymore. If you still use it, the theme will work as before but will generate a warning. So you don’t need to change anything, yet.\nWith the new mechanism, your dependency loader now receives an additional location parameter instead that you can query to inject your dependencies in the desired location.\nBy that you can now call the dependency mechanism in your own overriden partials by giving it a distinct location parameter. In addition your injected files can now be spread to multiple locations which wasn’t previously possible.\nNew New Additional styling was added for the native HTML elements \u003cmark\u003e and \u003ckbd\u003e. To use them you must allow the usage of HTML in your hugo.toml. The Markdown documentation was enhanced for this.\nNew You now can scroll forward and backward through all headings of a page by using ALT 🡑 and ALT 🡓. This also works for the PRINT output format.\nNew The breadcrumbs used in the topbar, search results and the taxonomy term lists are now using the pages front matter linktitle instead of title if set.\n5.26.0 (2024-03-18) New New The lazy loading of images is now configurable by using the new lazy image effect. The default value hasn’t changed in comparison to older versions, you don’t need to change anything.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the max width of the main area, eg. in case you want to use the full page width for your content.\nNew Images and Markdown codefences are now respecting Hugo’s Markdown attributes.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for block diagrams.\nNew This release fixes a long-standing bug where the page wasn’t repositioning correctly when going forward or backward in your browser history.\n5.25.0 (2024-02-29) Change Change This release deprecates the attachments shortcode in favor of the new the resources shortcode.\nIf you are using Hugo below 0.123.0, you don’t need to change anything as the old shortcode still works (but may generate warnings).\nAnyways, users are strongly advised to migrate as the attachments shortcode will not receive support anymore. Migration instructions are listed on the attachments shortcode page.\nChange If you run Hugo with GitInfo configured, the default page footer now prints out name, email address and date of the last commit. If you want to turn this off you either have to run Hugo without GitInfo (which is the default) or overwrite the content-footer.html partial.\n5.24.0 (2024-02-28) Hugo 0.112.4 0.112.4 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Change Change The topbar button received a way to add text next to the icon. For this, the original title option was renamed to hint while the new title option is now displayed next to the icon.\nChange The front matter option menuTitle is now deprecated in favor for Hugo’s own linkTitle. You don’t need to change anything as the old menuTitle option is still supported.\nChange The light themes have a bit more contrast for content text and headings. Also the syntaxhighlighting was changed to the more colorful MonokaiLight. This brings the syntaxhighlighting in sync with the corresponding dark theme variants, which are using Monokai. If you dislike this, you can create your own color variant file as described here.\nNew New If the theme can not resolve a link to a page or image, you can now generate warnings or errors during build by setting link.errorlevel or image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml respectively. By default this condition is silently ignored and the link is written as-is.\nPlease note that a page link will generate false negatives if uglyURLs=true and it references an ordinary page before 0.123.0.\nPlease note that an image link will generate false negatives if the file resides in your static directory.\nNew You now can configure additional options for every theme variant in your hugo.toml. This allows for optional advanced functionality. You don’t need to change anything as the old configuration options will still work (but may generate warnings now).\nThe advanced functionality allows you to set an explicit name for a theme variant and now allows for multiple auto mode variants that adjust to the light/dark preference of your OS settings.\nNew New partial for defining the heading. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Support for Hugo’s built-in figure shortcode.\nNew On taxonomy and term pages you can now use prev/next navigation as within the normal page structure.\nNew In additiion to the existing menu width customization, it is now also possible to set the width of the menu flyout for small screen sizes with the --MENU-WIDTH-S CSS property.\nNew Improvements for accessibility when tabbing through the page for images, links and tab handles.\nNew The editURL config parameter is now overwritable in your pages front matter. In addition it received more versatility by letting you control where to put the file path into the URL. This is achieved by replacing the variable ${FilePath} in your URL by the pages file path. You don’t need to change anything in your existing configuration as the old way without the replacement variable still works.\nNew The themes config and front matter options received a comprehensive documentation update. In addition the theme switched from config.toml to hugo.toml.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.121.0 or higher for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.123.0 or higher for theme specific output formats and handling of taxonomy and term titles. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\n5.23.0 (2023-11-03) Change Change With 0.120.0 the author settings move into the [params] array in your hugo.toml. Because this collides with the previous way, the theme expected author information, it now adheres to Hugo standards and prints out a warning during built if something is wrong.\nChange your previous setting from\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] author = 'Hugo' params: author: Hugo { \"params\": { \"author\": \"Hugo\" } } to\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] [params.author] name = 'Hugo' params: author: name: Hugo { \"params\": { \"author\": { \"name\": \"Hugo\" } } } Change Taxonomy term pages now add the breadcrumb for each listed page. If this gets too crowded for you, you can turn the breadcrumbs off in your hugo.toml by adding disableTermBreadcrumbs=true.\nNew New Taxonomy and term pages are now allowed to contain content. This is added inbetween the title and the page list.\nNew It is now possible to print custom taxonomies anywhere in your page. See the docs.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the menu width for your whole site. See the docs.\nNew This release adds social media meta tags for the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Cards to your site. See the docs.\nNew This release comes with additional sort options for the menu and the children shortcode. Both will now accept the following values: weight, title, linktitle, modifieddate, expirydate, publishdate, date, length or default (adhering to Hugo’s default sort order).\nNew The theme now provides a mechanism to load further JavaScript dependencies defined by you only if it is needed. This comes in handy if you want to add own shortcodes that depend on additional JavaScript code to be loaded. See the docs.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for the xychart type.\nNew This release adds portable Markdown links.\nPreviously it was not possible to use pure Markdown links in a configuration independent way to link to pages inside of your project. It always required you to know how your uglyURLs setting is, wheather you link to a page or page bundle and in case of relative links if your current page is a page or page bundle. (eg. [generator](generator/index.html) vs. [generator](generator.html)). This is a hassle as you have to change these links manually once you change your uglyURLs setting or change the type of a page.\nYou could work around this by using the relref shortcode (eg [generator]({{% relref \"../generator\" %}})) which works but results in non-portable Markdown.\nNow it’s possible to use the same path of a call to relref in a plain Markdown link (eg [generator](../generator)). This is independent of any configuration settings or the page types involved in linking. Note, that this requires your links to be given without any extension, so [generator](generator/index.html) will work as before.\nThe following types of linking are supported:\nlink description [generator](en/configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](/en/configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](/configuration/branding/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](./../generator) relative from the current page [generator](../generator) relative from the current page 5.22.0 (2023-10-02) Change Change This release fixes an issue where in unfortunate conditions DOM ids generated by Hugo may collide with DOM ids set by the theme. To avoid this, all theme DOM ids are now prefixed with R-.\nIf you haven’t modified anything, everything is fine. Otherwise you have to check your custom CSS rules and JavaScript code.\nChange You can now have structural sections in the hierarchical menu without generating a page for it.\nThis can come in handy, if content for such a section page doesn’t make much sense to you. See the documentation for how to do this.\nThis feature may require you to make changes to your existing installation if you are already using shortcuts to pages inside of your project with a headless branch parent.\nIn this case it is advised to remove the title from the headless branch parent’s front matter, as it will otherwise appear in your breadcrumbs.\nNew New It is now possible to overwrite the setting for collapsibleMenu of your hugo.toml inside of a page’s front matter.\nNew If a Mermaid graph is zoomable a button to reset the view is now added to the upper right corner. The button is only shown once the mouse is moved over the graph.\nNew It is now possible to remove the root breadcrumb by setting disableRootBreadcrumb=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew The output of the dedicated search page now displays the result’s breadcrumb.\nNew Table rows now change their background color on every even row.\nNew Translation into Swahili. This language is not supported for search.\n5.21.0 (2023-09-18) Change Change We made changes to the menu footer to improve alignment with the menu items in most cases. Care was taken not to break your existing overwritten footer. Anyways, if you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may want to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) of your partial. New New This release comes with an awesome new feature, that allows you to customize your topbar buttons, change behavior, reorder them or define entirely new ones, unique to your installation. See the documentation for further details.\nNew The theme has updated its Swagger dependency to 5.7.2 for the openapi shortcode. This brings support for OpenAPI Specification 3.1.\n5.20.0 (2023-08-26) Change Change The theme has updated its Swagger dependency to 5.4.1 for the openapi shortcode.\nWith this comes a change in the light theme variants of Relearn Bright, Relearn Light and Zen Light by switching the syntaxhighlighting inside of openapi to a light scheme. This brings it more in sync with the code style used by the theme variants itself.\nAdditionally, the syntaxhighlighting inside of openapi for printing was switched to a light scheme for all theme variants.\nIf you dislike this change, you can revert this in your theme variants CSS by adding\n--OPENAPI-CODE-theme: obsidian; --PRINT-OPENAPI-CODE-theme: obsidian; Change For consistency reasons, we renamed the CSS variable --MENU-SECTION-HR-color to --MENU-SECTION-SEPARATOR-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew New The theme variants Zen Light and Zen Dark now add more contrast between menu, topbar and content by adding thin borders.\nThose borders are now configurable by using the CSS variables --MAIN-TOPBAR-BORDER-color, --MENU-BORDER-color, --MENU-TOPBAR-BORDER-color, --MENU-TOPBAR-SEPARATOR-color, --MENU-HEADER-SEPARATOR-color and --MENU-SECTION-ACTIVE-CATEGORY-BORDER-color.\nFor existing variants nothing has changed visually.\nNew The default values for the image effects are now configurable for your whole site via hugo.toml or for each page through front matter.\nNew This release fixes a long-standing bug where Mermaid graphs could not be displayed if they were initially hidden - like in collapsed expand or inactive tabs.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions lower than 0.111.0 for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\n5.19.0 (2023-08-12) New New The highlight shortcode now accepts the new parameter title. This displays the code like a single tab. This is also available using Markdown codefences and makes it much easier to write nicer code samples.\nNew The theme has added two new color variants zen-light and zen-dark. Check it out!\nNew The theme now dispatches the custom event themeVariantLoaded on the document when the variant is fully loaded either initially or by switching the variant manually with the variant selector.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.3.1. This adds support for the sankey diagram type and now comes with full support for YAML inside Mermaid graphs (previously, the theme ignored explicit Mermaid theme settings in YAML).\nNew Translation into Hungarian.\n5.18.0 (2023-07-27) Change Change The theme adds additional warnings for deprecated or now unsupported features.\nChange There are visual improvements in displaying text links in your content as well as to some other clickable areas in the theme. If you’ve overwritten some theme styles in your own CSS, keep this in mind.\nNew New Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.95.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew The siteparam shortcode is now capable in displaying nested params as well as supporting text formatting.\n5.17.0 (2023-06-22) Change Change The default behavior for the copy-to-clipboard feature for code blocks has changed.\nThe copy-to-clipboard button for code blocks will now only be displayed if the reader hovers the code block.\nIf you dislike this new behavior you can turn it off and revert to the old behavior by adding [params] disableHoverBlockCopyToClipBoard=true to your hugo.toml.\nNew New Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.114.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew The new highlight shortcode replaces Hugo’s default implementation and is fully compatible. So you don’t need to change anything.\nIn addition it offers some extensions. Currently only the wrap extension option is provided to control whether a code block should be wrapped or scrolled if to long to fit.\n5.16.0 (2023-06-10) Change Change The theme now provides warnings for deprecated or now unsupported features. The warnings include hints how to fix them and an additional link to the documentation.\nDEPRECATION warnings mark features that still work but may be removed in the future.\nUNSUPPORTED warnings mark features that will not work anymore.\nChange The 404 error page was revamped. Hopefully you will not see this very often.\nNew New The tabs shortcode and the tab shortcode received some love and now align with their style, color, title and icon parameter to the other shortcodes.\nThe visuals are now slightly different compared to previous versions. Most noteable, if you now display a single code block in a tab, its default styling will adapt to that of a code block but with a tab handle at the top.\nAdditionally the name parameter was renamed to title but you don’t need to change anything yet as the old name will be used as a fallback. Nevertheless you will get deprecation warnings while executing Hugo.\nNew The theme now optionally supports separate favicons for light \u0026 dark mode.\n5.15.0 (2023-05-29) Change Change Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.112.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nThe attachments shortcode has compatibility issues with newer Hugo versions. You must switch to leaf bundles or are locked to Hugo \u003c 0.112.0 for now.\nIt is planned to refactor the attchments shortcode in the future. This will make it possible to use the shortcode in branch bundles again but not in simple pages anymore. This will most likely come with a breaking change.\nChange The tabs shortcode has changed behavior if you haven’t set the groupid parameter.\nFormerly all tab views without a groupid were treated as so they belong to the same group. Now, each tab view is treated as it was given a unique id.\nNew New The already known tabshas a new friend the tab shortcode to make it easier to create a tab view in case you only need one single tab. Really handy if you want to flag your code examples with a language identifier.\nAdditionally for such a use case, the whitespace between a tab outline and the code is removed if only a single code block is contained.\nNew Besides the tag taxonomy the theme now also provides the category taxonomy out of the box and shows them in the content footer of each page.\n5.14.0 (2023-05-20) New New The taxonomy pages received some love in this release, making them better leverage available screen space and adding translation support for the taxonomy names.\nHugo’s default taxonmies tags and categories are already contained in the theme’s i18n files. If you have self-defined taxonomies, you can add translations by adding them to your own i18n files. If you don’t provide translations, the singualar and plural forms are taken as configured in your hugo.toml.\nNew To give you more flexibility in customizing your article layout a new partial content-header.html is introduced.\nThis came out of the requirement to customize the position of article tags, which by default are displayed above the title. A second requirement was to also show additional taxonomies not supported by the theme natively. While Hugo supports tags and categories by default, the theme only displays tags.\nSo how to adjust the position of tags starting from the theme’s default where tags are only shown above the title?\nHide tags above title: Overwrite content-header.html with an empty file. Show tags between title and content: Overwrite heading-post.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. Show tags below content: Overwrite content-footer.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. New The new parameter breadcrumbSeparator is now available in your hugo.toml to change the - well - separator of the breadcrumb items. An appropriate default is in place if you do not configure anything.\n5.13.0 (2023-05-17) Change Change The swagger shortcode was deprecated in favor for the openapi shortcode. You don’t need to change anything yet as the old name will be used as a fallback. It is planned to remove the swagger shortcode in the next major release.\nAdditionally, the implemantion of this shortcode was switched from RapiDoc to SwaggerUI.\n5.12.0 (2023-05-04) Change Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed (again). While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works. New New Support for the great VSCode Front Matter CMS extension which provides on-premise CMS capabilties to Hugo.\nThe theme provides Front Matter CMS snippets for its shortcodes. Currently only English and German is supported. Put a reference into your frontmatter.json like this\n​ frontmatter.json { ... \"frontMatter.extends\": [ \"./vscode-frontmatter/snippets.en.json\" ] ... } New Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic) is now complete and extended to the menu, the top navigation bar and print. You can experience this in the pirate translation. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew The scrollbars are now colored according to their variant color scheme to better fit into the visuals.\n5.11.0 (2023-02-07) Change Change The theme removed the popular jQuery library from its distribution.\nIn case you made changes to the theme that are depending on this library you can place a copy of jQuery into your static/js directory and load it from your own layouts/partials/custom-header.html like this:\n​ layouts/partials/custom-header.html \u003cscript src=\"{{\"js/jquery.min.js\"| relURL}}\" defer\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change Mermaid diagrams can now be configured for pan and zoom on site-, page-level or individually for each graph.\nThe default setting of on, in effect since 1.1.0, changed back to off as there was interference with scrolling on mobile and big pages.\nChange The theme is now capable to visually adapt to your OS’s light/dark mode setting.\nThis is also the new default setting if you haven’t configured themeVariant in your hugo.toml.\nAdditionally you can configure the variants to be taken for light/dark mode with the new themeVariantAuto parameter.\nThis is not supported for Internet Explorer 11, which still displays in the relearn-light variant.\nChange The JavaScript code for handling image lightboxes (provided by Featherlight) was replaced by a CSS-only solution.\nThis also changed the lightbox effects parameter from featherlight=false to lightbox=false. Nevertheless you don’t need to change anything as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the expand shortcode was changed. While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew New Translation into Czech. This language is not supported for search.\nNew GitHub releases are also now tagged for the main version (eg. 1.2.x), major version (eg. 1.x) and the latest (just x) release making it easier for you to pin the theme to a certain version.\n5.10.0 (2023-01-25) New New The attachments, badge, button and notice shortcodes have a new parameter color to set arbitrary CSS color values.\nAdditionally the --ACCENT-color brand color introduced in version 5.8.0 is now supported with these shortcodes.\n5.9.0 (2022-12-23) Breaking Breaking With this version it is now possible to not only have sections on the first menu level but also pages.\nIt was later discovered, that this causes pages only meant to be displayed in the More section of the menu and stored directly inside your content directory to now show up in the menu as well.\nTo get rid of this undesired behavior you have two choices:\nMake the page file a headless branch bundle (contained in its own subdirectory and called _index.md) and add the following front matter configuration to the file (see exampleSite’s content/showcase/_index.en.md). This causes its content to not be ontained in the sitemap.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'Showcase' [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = true render = 'always' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: true render: always title: Showcase --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": true, \"render\": \"always\" }, \"title\": \"Showcase\" } Store the page file for below a parent headless branch bundle and add the following front matter to he parent (see exampleSite’s content/more/_index.en.md). Don’t give this page a title as this will cause it to be shown in the breadcrumbs - a thing you most likely don’t want.\n​ toml yaml json +++ [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = false render = 'never' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: false render: never --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": false, \"render\": \"never\" } } In this case, the file itself can be a branch bundle, leaf bundle or simple page (see exampleSite’s content/more/credits.en.md). This causes its content to be contained in the sitemap.\n​ toml yaml json +++ title = 'Credits' +++ --- title: Credits --- { \"title\": \"Credits\" } Change Change The required directory name for the attachments shortcode was changed for leaf bundles.\nPreviously, the attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups were required to be in a files subdirectory. For page bundles and leaf bundles in multilang setups they were always required to be in a _index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files or index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files subdirectory accordingly.\nThis added unnecessary complexity. So attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups can now also reside in a index.files directory. Although the old files directory is now deprecated, if both directories are present, only the old files directory will be used for compatibility.\nChange Absolute links prefixed with http:// or https:// are now opened in a separate browser tab.\nYou can revert back to the old behavior by defining externalLinkTarget=\"_self\" in the params section of your hugo.toml.\nNew New The theme now supports Hugo’s module system. 5.8.0 (2022-12-08) New New The new badge shortcode is now available to add highly configurable markers to your content as you can see it on this page.\nNew The new icon shortcode simplyfies the usage of icons. This can even be combined with also new badge shortcode.\nNew The theme now supports some of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) syntax and Hugo Markdown extensions, namely task lists, defintion lists and footnotes.\nNew A new color --ACCENT-color was introduced which is used for highlighting search results on the page. In case you simply don’t care, you don’t need to change anything in your variant stylesheet as the old yellow color is still used as default.\n5.7.0 (2022-11-29) Change Change The Korean language translation for this theme is now available with the language code ko. Formerly the country code kr was used instead. New New The button shortcode can now also be used as a real button inside of HTML forms - although this is a pretty rare use case. The documentation was updated accordingly.\nNew The search now supports the Korean language.\n5.6.0 (2022-11-18) New New This release introduces an additional dedicated search page. On this page, displayed search results have more space making it easier scanning through large number of results.\nTo activate this feature, you need to configure it in your hugo.toml as a new outputformat searchpage for the home page. If you don’t configure it, no dedicated search page will be accessible and the theme works as before.\nYou can access the search page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or pressing enter inside of the search box.\nNew Keyboard handling for the TOC and search was improved.\nPressing CTRL+ALT+t now will not only toggle the TOC overlay but also places the focus to the first heading on opening. Subsequently this makes it possible to easily select headings by using the TAB key.\nThe search received its own brand new keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+f. This will focus the cursor inside of the search box so you can immediately start your search by typing.\nNew You are now able to turn off the generation of generator meta tags in your HTML head to hide the used versions of Hugo and this theme.\nTo configure this in your hugo.toml make sure to set Hugo’s disableHugoGeneratorInject=true and also [params] disableGeneratorVersion=true, otherwise Hugo will generate a meta tag into your home page automagically.\nNew Creation of your project gets a little bit faster with this release.\nThis addresses increased build time with the version 5 releases. The theme now heavily caches partial results leading to improved performance. To further increase performance, unnecessary parts of the page are now skipped for creation of the print output (eg. menus, navigation bar, etc.).\n5.5.0 (2022-11-06) Change Change The way images are processed has changed. Now images are lazy loaded by default which speeds up page load on slow networks and/or big pages and also the print preview.\nFor that the JavaScript code to handle the lightbox and image effects on the client side was removed in favour for static generation of those effects on the server.\nIf you have used HTML directly in your Markdown files, this now has the downside that it doesn’t respect the effect query parameter anymore. In this case you have to migrate all your HTML img URLs manually to the respective HTML attributes.\nOld New \u003cimg src=\"pic.png?width=20vw\u0026classes=shadow,border\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"pic.png\" style=\"width:20vw;\" class=\"shadow border\"\u003e 5.4.0 (2022-11-01) Change Change With the proper settings in your hugo.toml your page is now servable from the local file system using file:// URLs.\nPlease note that the searchbox will only work for this if you reconfigure your outputformat for the home page in your hugo.toml from json to search. The now deprecated json outputformat still works as before, so there is no need to reconfigure your installation if it is only served from http:// or https://.\nChange The button shortcode has a new parameter target to set the destination frame/window for the URL to open. If not given, it defaults to a new window/tab for external URLs or is not set at all for internal URLs. Previously even internal URLs where opened in a new window/tab.\nNew New The math shortcode and mermaid shortcode now also support the align parameter if Markdown codefences are used.\nNew Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic). This is only implemented for the content area but not the navigation sidebar. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew Translation into Finnish (Suomi).\n5.3.0 (2022-10-07) Change Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed. The functionality of the new implementation does not work with old browsers (Internet Explorer 11). New New Image formatting has two new classes to align images to the left or right. Additionally, the already existing inline option is now documented.\nNew Printing for the swagger shortcode was optimized to expand sections that are usually closed in interactive mode. This requires print support to be configured.\n5.2.0 (2022-08-03) Change Change If you’ve set collapsibleMenu = true in your hugo.toml, the menu will be expanded if a search term is found in a collapsed submenu. The menu will return to its initial collapse state once the search term does not match any submenus. 5.1.0 (2022-07-15) Hugo 0.95.0 0.95.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Change Change Because the print preview URLs were non deterministic for normal pages in comparison to page bundles, this is now changed. Each print preview is now accessible by adding a index.print.html to the default URL.\nYou can revert this behavior by overwriting the print output format setting in your hugo.tomlto:\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputFormats] [outputFormats.print] baseName = 'index' isHTML = true mediaType = 'text/html' name = 'print' path = '_print' permalinkable = false outputFormats: print: baseName: index isHTML: true mediaType: text/html name: print path: _print permalinkable: false { \"outputFormats\": { \"print\": { \"baseName\": \"index\", \"isHTML\": true, \"mediaType\": \"text/html\", \"name\": \"print\", \"path\": \"_print\", \"permalinkable\": false } } } 5.0.0 (2022-07-05) Breaking Breaking The theme changed how JavaScript and CSS dependencies are loaded to provide a better performance. In case you’ve added own JavaScript code that depends on the themes jQuery implementation, you have to put it into a separate *.js file (if not already) and add the defer keyword to the script element. Eg.\n\u003cscript defer src=\"myscript.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change Change The way archetypes are used to generate output has changed. The new systems allows you, to redefine existing archetypes or even generate your own ones.\nYour existing markdown files will still work like before and therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade. Nevertheless, it is recommended to adapt your existing markdown files to the new way as follows:\nfor your home page, add the front matter parameter archetype = \"home\" and remove the leading heading\nfor all files containing the deprecated front matter parameter chapter = true, replace it with archetype = \"chapter\" and remove the leading headings\nChange The front matter options pre / post were renamed to menuPre / menuPost. The old options will still be used if the new options aren’t set. Therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade.\nNew New Adding new partials heading-pre.html / heading-post.html and according front matter options headingPre / headingPost to modify the way your page`s main heading gets styled.\nNew The new shortcode math is available to add beautiful math and chemical formulae. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.",

If you haven’t used this parameter in your shortcode, the default behavior hasn’t changed and you don’t need to change anything.\nIf you’ve used the second boolean parameter, you have to rename it and invert its value to achieve the same behavior.\nChange Change Previously, if the tabs shortcode could not find a tab item because, the tabs ended up empty. Now the first tab is selected instead.\nChange The landingPageURL was removed from hugo.toml. You can safely remove this as well from your configuration as it is not used anymore. The theme will detect the landing page URL automatically and will point to the project’s home page. If you want to support a different link, overwrite the logo.html partial.\nNew New All shortcodes can now be also called from your partials. Examples for this are added to the documentation of each shortcode. 4.1.0 (2022-06-12) New New While fixing issues with the search functionality for non Latin languages, you can now configure to have multiple languages on a single page. 4.0.0 (2022-06-05) Breaking Breaking The custom_css config parameter was removed from the configuration. If used in an existing installation, it can be achieved by overriding the custom-header.html template in a much more generic manner.\nBreaking Because anchor hover color was not configurable without introducing more complexity to the variant stylesheets, we decided to remove --MAIN-ANCHOR-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the anchors now get their colors from --MAIN-LINK-color and --MAIN-ANCHOR-HOVER-color respectively.\nNew New All shortcodes now support named parameter. The positional parameter are still supported but will not be enhanced with new features, so you don’t need to change anything in your installation.\nThis applies to expand, include, notice and siteparam.\nNew The button shortcode received some love and now has a parameter for the color style similar to other shortcodes.\nNew New colors --PRIMARY-color and --SECONDARY-color were added to provide easier modification of your custom style. Shortcodes with a color style can now have primary or secondary as additional values.\nThese two colors are the default for other, more specific color variables. You don’t need to change anything in your existing custom color stylesheets as those variables get reasonable default values.\nNew Translation into Polish. This language is not supported for search.\nNew The documentation for all shortcodes were revised.",

    "content": "3.4.0 (2022-04-03) Breaking Breaking If you had previously overwritten the custom-footer.html partial to add visual elements below the content of your page, you have to move this content to the new partial content-footer.html. custom-footer.html was never meant to contain HTML other than additional styles and JavaScript. New New If you prefer expandable/collapsible menu items, you can now set collapsibleMenu=true in your hugo.toml. This will add arrows to all menu items that contain sub menus. The menu will expand/collapse without navigation if you click on an arrow.\nNew You can activate print support in your hugo.toml to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site.\nNew Translation into Traditional Chinese.\n3.3.0 (2022-03-28) New New Introduction of new CSS variables to set the font. The theme distinguishes between --MAIN-font for all content text and --CODE-font for inline or block code. There are additional overrides for all headings. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for all available variables.\nNew The new shortcode swagger is available to include a UI for REST OpenAPI specifications. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n3.2.0 (2022-03-19) Hugo 0.93.0 0.93.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Change Change In this release the Mermaid JavaScript library will only be loaded on demand if the page contains a Mermaid shortcode or is using Markdown codefences. This changes the behavior of disableMermaid config option as follows: If a Mermaid shortcode or Markdown codefence is found, the option will be ignored and Mermaid will be loaded regardlessly.\nThe option is still useful in case you are using scripting to set up your graph. In this case no shortcode or Markdown codefence is involved and the library is not loaded by default. In this case you can set disableMermaid=false in your front matter to force the library to be loaded. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for an example.\nNew New Additional color variant variable --MERMAID-theme to set the variant’s Mermaid theme. This causes the Mermaid theme to switch with the color variant if it defers from the setting of the formerly selected color variant. 3.1.0 (2022-03-15) New New attachment and notice shortcodes have a new parameter to override the default icon. Allowed values are all Font Awesome 5 Free icons. 3.0.0 (2022-02-22) Breaking Breaking We made changes to the menu footer. If you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may have to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) in your partial. For a reference take a look into the menu-footer.html partial that is coming with the exampleSite.\nThis change was made to allow your own menu footer to be placed right after the so called prefooter that comes with the theme (containing the language switch and Clear history functionality).\nBreaking We have changed the default colors from the original Learn theme (the purple menu header) to the Relearn defaults (the light green menu header) as used in the official documentation.\nThis change will only affect your installation if you’ve not set the themeVariant parameter in your hugo.toml. If you still want to use the Learn color variant, you have to explicitly set themeVariant=\"learn\" in your hugo.toml.\nNote, that this will also affect your site if viewed with Internet Explorer 11 but in this case it can not be reconfigured as Internet Explorer does not support CSS variables.\nChange Change Due to a bug, that we couldn’t fix in a general manner for color variants, we decided to remove --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-ICONS-color and introduced --MENU-SEARCH-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange For consistency reasons, we renamed --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-color to --MENU-SEARCH-BORDER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew New With this release you are now capable to define your own dark mode variants.\nTo make this possible, we have introduced a lot more color variables you can use in your color variants. Your old variants will still work and don’t need to be changed as appropriate fallback values are used by the theme. Nevertheless, the new colors allow for much more customization.\nTo see what’s now possible, see the new variants relearn-dark and neon that are coming with this release.\nNew To make the creation of new variants easier for you, we’ve added a new interactive theme variant generator. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\nNew You can now configure multiple color variants in your hugo.toml. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer. See the documentation for configuration.\nNote, that the new variant selector will not work with Internet Explorer 11 as it does not support CSS variables. Therefore, the variant selector will not be displayed with Internet Explorer 11.",

    "content": "2.9.0 (2021-11-19) Breaking Breaking This release removes the themes implementation of ref/relref in favor for Hugo’s standard implementation. This is because of inconsistencies with the themes implementation. In advantage, your project becomes standard compliant and exchanging this theme in your project to some other theme will be effortless.\nIn a standard compliant form you must not link to the *.md file but to its logical name. You’ll see, referencing other pages becomes much easier. All three types result in the same reference:\nType Non-Standard Standard Branch bundle configuration/reference/_index.md configuration/reference Leaf bundle configuration/reference/index.md configuration/reference Page configuration/reference.md configuration/reference If you’ve linked from a page of one language to a page of another language, conversion is a bit more difficult but Hugo got you covered as well.\nAlso, the old themes implementation allowed refs to non-existing content. This will cause Hugo’s implementation to show the error below and abort the generation. If your project relies on this old behavior, you can reconfigure the error handling of Hugo’s implementation.\nIn the best case your usage of the old implementation is already standard compliant and you don’t need to change anything. You’ll notice this very easily once you’ve started hugo server after an upgrade and no errors are written to the console.\nYou may see errors on the console after the update in the form:\nERROR 2021/11/19 22:29:10 [en] REF_NOT_FOUND: Ref \"configuration/reference/_index.md\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\\exampleSite\\content\\_index.en.md:19:22\": page not found In this case, you must apply one of two options:\nStart up a text editor with regular expression support for search and replace. Search for (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*?)(?:/_index|/index)?(?:\\.md)?(#[^\"]*?)?\" and replace it by $1$2\" in all *.md files. This is the recommended choice.\nCopy the old implementation files theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/ref.html and theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/relref.html to your own projects layouts/shortcode/ref.html and layouts/shortcode/relref.html respectively. This is not recommended as your project will still rely on non-standard behavior afterwards.\n2.8.0 (2021-11-03) Change Change Although never officially documented, this release removes the font Novacento/Novecento. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with Work Sans. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for Czech. New New The theme now supports favicons served from static/images/ named as favicon or logo in SVG, PNG or ICO format out of the box. An overridden partial layouts/partials/favicon.html may not be necessary anymore in most cases.\nNew You can hide the table of contents menu for the whole site by setting the disableToc option in your hugo.toml. For an example see the example configuration.\n2.7.0 (2021-10-24) New New Optional second parameter for notice shortcode to set title in box header. 2.6.0 (2021-10-21) New New Your site can now be served from a subdirectory if you set baseURL in your hugo.toml. See the documentation for a detailed example. 2.5.0 (2021-10-08) Change Change New colors --CODE-BLOCK-color and --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color were added to provide a fallback for Hugo’s syntax highlighting in case no language was given or the language is unsupported. Ideally the colors are set to the same values as the ones from your chosen chroma style. 2.4.0 (2021-10-07) Change Change Creation of customized stylesheets was simplified down to only contain the CSS variables. Everything else can and should be deleted from your custom stylesheet to assure everything works fine. For the predefined stylesheet variants, this change is already included. New New Hidden pages are displayed by default in their according tags page. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableTagHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus for the whole site by setting the alwaysopen option in your hugo.toml. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New front matter ordersectionsby option to change immediate children sorting in menu and children shortcode. Possible values are title or weight.\nNew Alternate content of a page is now advertised in the HTML meta tags. See Hugo documentation.\n2.3.0 (2021-09-13) Hugo 0.81.0 0.81.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. New New Showcase multilanguage features by providing a documentation translation “fer us pirrrates”. There will be no other translations besides the original English one and the Piratish one due to maintenance constraints. 2.2.0 (2021-09-09) New New Hidden pages are displayed by default in the sitemap generated by Hugo and are therefore visible for search engine indexing. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSeoHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml. 2.1.0 (2021-09-07) Hugo 0.69.0 0.69.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Change Change In case the site’s structure contains additional *.md files not part of the site (eg files that are meant to be included by site pages - see CHANGELOG.md in the exampleSite), they will now be ignored by the search. New New Hidden pages are indexed for the site search by default. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSearchHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew If a search term is found in an expand shortcode, the expand will be opened.\nNew The menu will scroll the active item into view on load.\n2.0.0 (2021-08-28) Change Change Syntax highlighting was switched to the built in Hugo mechanism. You may need to configure a new stylesheet or decide to roll you own as described on in the Hugo documentation\nChange In the predefined stylesheets there was a typo and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVERED-color must be changed to --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange --MENU-HOME-LINK-color and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color were missing in the documentation. You should add them to your custom stylesheets if you want to override the defaults.\nChange Arrow navigation and children shortcode were ignoring setting for ordersectionsby. This is now changed and may result in different sorting order of your sub pages.\nChange If hidden pages are accessed directly by typing their URL, they will be exposed in the menu.\nChange A page without a title will be treated as hidden=true.\nNew New You can define the expansion state of your menus in the front matter. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New partials for defining pre/post content for menu items and the content. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Shortcode children with new parameter containerstyle.\nNew New shortcode include to include arbitrary file content into a page.",

If you haven’t done any undocumented stuff with the stylesheets, this change should not have any negative effects to your site.\nAnyways, please note that now the variant generator is not included in the theme release anymore but is only available in the exampleSite docs. As a sideeffect, less JavaScript will be loaded on your site.\nNew New As a fallout of fixing the flashing issue, you can now minify the bundled stylesheets by setting the minify parameter in your hugo.toml. Without configuring this parameter, the theme will minify the stylesheets for production (hugo) but not for development (hugo server).\nNew The notice shortcode was improved for accessibility and comes with a brand new parameter groupid.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 11.4.1. This adds support for Kanban diagrams.\nNew Translation into Persian. This language is not supported for search.",

Each color variant contains of a CSS file and optional settings in your hugo.toml.\nYou can use the shipped variants, customize them, or create your own. The interactive variant generator can help you with this.\nOnce set up in hugo.toml, you can switch variants using the selector at the bottom of the menu.\nShipped Variants The theme ships with the following set of variants\nRelearn Light: the classic Relearn default, coming with signature green, dark sidebar and light content area Dark: dark variant of Light, coming with signature green, dark sidebar and dark content area Bright: alternative of Light, coming with signature green, green sidebar and light content area Zen Light: a more relaxed white/grey variant, coming with blue accents, light sidebar and light content area Dark: dark variant of Light, coming with blue accents, dark sidebar and dark content area Experimental Neon: a variant that glows in the dark, gradient sidebar and dark content area Retro Learn: the default of the old Learn theme, coming with signature light purple, dark sidebar and light content area Blue: a blue variant of the old Learn theme, coming tinted in blue, dark sidebar and light content area Green: a green variant of the old Learn theme, coming tinted in green, dark sidebar and light content area Red: a red variant of the old Learn theme, coming tinted in red, dark sidebar and light content area Changing the Variant Option Set the themeVariant option to change the variant.\nThe theme offers the recommended advanced configuration mode that combines the functionality for multiple variants, OS setting adjustments, and more.\nSimple Setup Single Variant Set themeVariant to your theme CSS file name:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = 'relearn-light' params: themeVariant: relearn-light { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": \"relearn-light\" } } Place your theme file in assets/css or themes/hugo-theme-relearn/assets/css. Name it theme-*.css.\nIn the above example, the path of your theme file must be assets/css/theme-relearn-light.css or themes/hugo-theme-relearn/assets/css/theme-relearn-light.css.\nMultiple Variants To let the reader choose between multiple variants, set themeVariant like this:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = ['relearn-light', 'relearn-dark'] params: themeVariant: - relearn-light - relearn-dark { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] } } The first variant is the default, and a selector will appear if there’s more than one.\nAdjust to OS Settings Use the auto value to match OS light/dark settings. Usually it makes sense to set it in the first position and make it the default.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = ['auto', 'red'] params: themeVariant: - auto - red { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"auto\", \"red\" ] } } If you don’t configure anything else, the theme will default to use relearn-light for light mode and relearn-dark for dark mode.\nDefault is relearn-light for light and relearn-dark for dark mode. These defaults are overwritten by the first two non-auto options of your themeVariant array.\nYou can override the default with themeVariantAuto:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariantAuto = ['learn', 'neon'] params: themeVariantAuto: - learn - neon { \"params\": { \"themeVariantAuto\": [ \"learn\", \"neon\" ] } } Advanced The theme offers an advanced way to configure theme variants and all of the aspects above inside of a single configuration item. This comes with some features previously unsupported.\nLike with the multiple variants option, you are defining your theme variants in an array but now in a table with suboptions.\nAgain, in this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer if the array contains more than one entry.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = ['relearn-light', 'relearn-dark'] params: themeVariant: - relearn-light - relearn-dark { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] } } you now write it that way:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-dark' params: themeVariant: - identifier: relearn-light - identifier: relearn-dark { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ { \"identifier\": \"relearn-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-dark\" } ] } } The identifier option is mandatory and equivalent to the string in the first example. Further options can be configured, see the table below.\nParameter Name Default Notes identifier \u003cempty\u003e Must correspond to the name of a color variant either in your site’s or the theme’s directory in the form assets/css/theme-\u003cIDENTIFIER\u003e.css. name see notes The name to be displayed in the variant selector. If not set, the identifier is used in a human readable form. auto \u003cempty\u003e If set, the variant is treated as an auto mode variant. It has the same behavior as the themeVariantAuto option.

Don’t edit the file in the theme’s directory! You will lose the ability to later easily upgrade your theme to a newer version.\nCopy and change\nYou can copy the shipped variant file from the theme’s themes/hugo-theme-relearn/assets/css directory to the site’s assets/css directory and either store it with the same name or give it a new name. Edit the settings and save the new file. Afterwards, you can use it in your hugo.toml by the chosen name.\nCreate and import\nYou can create a new variant file in the site’s assets/css directory and give it a new name. Import the shipped variant, add the settings you want to change and save the new file. Afterwards, you can use it in your hugo.toml by the chosen name.\nFor example, you want to use the relearn-light variant but want to change the syntax highlighting schema to the one used in the neon variant. For that, create a new assets/css/theme-my-branding.css in your site’s directory and add the following lines:\n​ assets/css/theme-my-branding.css @import \"theme-relearn-light.css\"; :root { --CODE-theme: neon; /* name of the chroma stylesheet file */ --CODE-BLOCK-color: rgba( 226, 228, 229, 1 ); /* fallback color for code text */ --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color: rgba( 40, 42, 54, 1 ); /* fallback color for code background */ } Afterwards, put this in your hugo.toml to use your new variant:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] themeVariant = 'my-branding' params: themeVariant: my-branding { \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": \"my-branding\" } } In comparison to copy and change, this has the advantage that you profit from any adjustments to the relearn-light variant while keeping your modifications.\nReact to Variant Switches in JavaScript Once a color variant is fully loaded, either initially or by switching the color variant manually with the variant selector, the custom event themeVariantLoaded on the document will be dispatched. You can add an event listener and react to changes.\n​ JavaScript document.addEventListener( 'themeVariantLoaded', function( e ){ console.log( e.detail.variant ); // `relearn-light` });",

    "content": "A common question is how to add extra CSS styles or JavaScript to your site. This depends on what you need.\nAdding JavaScript or Stylesheets to All Pages To add JavaScript files or CSS stylesheets to every page, you can include them in layouts/partials/custom-header.html or layouts/partials/custom-footer.html.\nHowever, this can make your site larger than necessary if these files are only needed on a few pages. The next section explains how to add dependencies only when needed.\nCustom Shortcodes with Dependencies Some shortcodes need extra JavaScript and CSS files. The theme only loads these when the shortcode is used. You can use this for your own shortcodes too.\nFor example, to create a shortcode called myshortcode that needs the jquery library:\nCreate the shortcode file layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html and add the folloging line somewhere:\n​ layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html ... {{- .Page.Store.Set \"hasMyShortcode\" true }} ... Option Add this to your hugo.toml:\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] [params.relearn] [params.relearn.dependencies] [params.relearn.dependencies.myshortcode] name = 'MyShortcode' params: relearn: dependencies: myshortcode: name: MyShortcode { \"params\": { \"relearn\": { \"dependencies\": { \"myshortcode\": { \"name\": \"MyShortcode\" } } } } } Create loader file layouts/partials/dependencies/myshortcode.html:\n​ layouts/partials/dependencies/myshortcode.html {{- if eq .location \"footer\" }} \u003cscript src=\"https://www.unpkg.com/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e {{- end }} Important notes:\nCharacter casing is relevant! The name in hugo.toml must match the Store key used in the shortcode file, prefixed with a has. The key of relearn.dependencies must match the loader file name. See the math, mermaid, and openapi shortcodes for examples.\nNote For advanced customization, you can use the dependency loader in your own partials:\n{{- partial \"dependencies.gotmpl\" (dict \"page\" . \"location\" \"mylocation\") }} Give a unique name for the location parameter when you call it, so you can distinguish your loaders behavior depending on the location it was called from.",

If you upgrade the theme, in many cases, you need also to upgrade Hugo and vice versa.\nThe releasenotes of the theme mention if a newer version of Hugo is required.\nNote, that it is only necessary to upgrade if you are experiencing fixed bugs or want to use new features. It is perfectly fine to stay with arbitrary old versions of Hugo and the theme if everything works for you.\nPlanning the Upgrade Depending on your previously used version of Hugo and the theme, you might need to upgrade files of your project.\nThe releasenotes announce theme related modifications and help you identifying spots in your files that require changes.\nAlso watch the console during build of your project, as it may show further warnings or errors with hints of what’s wrong and how to fix it.\nNote that these hints may be removed after a while by Hugo or the theme. In case you are updating from rather far beyond versions, consider to do the upgrade in steps:\nSay, you are using Relearn 4.0.1 and want to upgrade your project to the latest version (say 7.2.1):\nfind out the last theme release of version 4 (which is 4.2.5) and the required Hugo version (at least 0.93.0, taken from the releasenotes of version 3 as version 4 did not raise the Hugo version) and upgrade run hugo server and fix any errors find out the last theme release of version 5 (which is 5.27.0) and the required Hugo version (at least 0.121.0) and upgrade run hugo server and fix any errors etc. until done This procedure may lead to more work than updating in one single step, but it will be far easier to make adaptions and can be divided into smaller units of work.\nUpgrade the Theme Updating the theme depends on the way how you’ve installed it.\nRun all following commands from the root of your Hugo project.\nDownload as a Zip File Remove the old version of the theme by removing the themes/hugo-theme-relearn directory.\nDownload the .zip archive of a certain version of the theme and unzip it into the themes/hugo-theme-relearn directory\nEg. to upgrade to version 7.2.1 download from https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/releases/tag/7.2.1\nUse Hugo’s Module System Upgrade the Relearn theme using Hugo’s module system to a certain version.\nEg. to upgrade to version 7.2.1\nhugo mod get -u github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn@7.2.1 Use as a Git Submodule Upgrade the Relearn theme using Git to a certain version.\nEg. to upgrade to version 7.2.1\ngit submodule update --depth 1 themes/hugo-theme-relearn git -C themes/hugo-theme-relearn fetch --tags --force git -C themes/hugo-theme-relearn checkout 7.2.1",

    "content": "Let’s face it: Writing content for the web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid HTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. John Gruber\nTip Bookmark this page for easy future reference!\nStandard and Extensions If not otherwise noted, the shown examples adhere to the CommonMark standard. In addition the theme supports the following extensions that can be activated in your hugo.toml or are built into the theme:\nGFM Extension on top of standard Markdown adhering to GitHub Flavored Markdown.\nPHP Extension on top of standard Markdown adhering to PHP Markdown.\nPants Extension by John Gruber adhering to SmartyPants.\nHugo Hugo Extra Extension supported by Hugo.\nObsidian Extension implemented by Obsidian.\nHTML If the usage of HTML is allowed, the theme supports styling for further HTML elements.\nRelearn Extension specific to this theme.\nParagraphs In Markdown your content usually spans the whole available document width. This is called a block. Blocks are always separated by whitespace to their adjacent blocks in the resulting document.\nAny text not starting with a special sign is written as normal, plain text paragraph block and must be separated to its adjacent blocks by empty lines.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nHeadings A good idea is to structure your content using headings and subheadings. HTML-headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level.\nIn Hugo you usually don’t use h1 as this is generated by your theme and you should only have one such element in a document.\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Result h1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading Horizontal Rules To further structure your content you can add horizontal rules. They create a “thematic break” between paragraph blocks. In Markdown, you can create it with three consecutive dashes ---.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. --- Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nBlockquotes Quotations For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document add \u003e before any text you want to quote.\nBlockquotes can also be nested.\n\u003e Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue. Nunc augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi. \u003e \u003e \u003e Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor odio non est accumsan facilisis.

Vestibulum aliquet sollicitudin erat, ut aliquet purus posuere luctus.\nGitHub Alerts GFM Since Hugo 0.132.0 GitHub alerts are also supported. Please note, that coloring and icons of severities may defer between GitHub and this theme.\nIf you are in need of more advanced options to style your alerts, like icons, use the notice shortcode.\n\u003e [!CAUTION] \u003e Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions. \u003e [!IMPORTANT] \u003e Key information users need to know to achieve their goal. \u003e [!INFO] \u003e Information that users \u003cins\u003e_might_\u003c/ins\u003e find interesting. \u003e [!NOTE] \u003e Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content. \u003e [!TIP] \u003e Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily. \u003e [!WARNING] \u003e Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

See Hugo’s documentation remarks if you want to use this together with the subscript syntax.\n~~Strike through~~ this text Result Strike through this text\nSpecial Typesetting Text Substitution Pants You can combine multiple punctuation characters to single typographic entities. This will only be applied to text outside of code blocks or inline code.\nDouble quotes `\"` and single quotes `'` of enclosed text are replaced by **\"double curly quotes\"** and **'single curly quotes'**. Double dashes `--` and triple dashes `---` are replaced by en-dash **--** and em-dash **---** entities. Double arrows pointing left `\u003c\u003c` or right `\u003e\u003e` are replaced by arrow **\u003c\u003c** and **\u003e\u003e** entities. Three consecutive dots `...` are replaced by an ellipsis **...** entity. Result Double quotes \" and single quotes ' of enclosed text are replaced by “double curly quotes” and ‘single curly quotes’.\nDouble dashes -- and triple dashes --- are replaced by en-dash – and em-dash — entities.\nDouble arrows pointing left \u003c\u003c or right \u003e\u003e are replaced by arrow « and » entities.\nThree consecutive dots ... are replaced by an ellipsis … entity.\nSubscript and Superscript You can also use subscript and superscript text. For more complex stuff, you can use the math shortcode.\nHugo Since Hugo 0.126.0, you can activate this through the Hugo Extra Extension in your hugo.toml\nHow many liters H~2~O fit into 1dm^3^? HTML You can also use it by configuring Hugo for usage of HTML.\nHow many liters H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003eO fit into 1dm\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e?

Result Press STRG ALT DEL to end your shift early.\nLists Unordered You can write a list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.\nIt is possible to nest lists by indenting an item for the next sublevel.\nYou may use any of -, * or + to denote bullets for each list item but should not switch between those symbols inside one whole list.\n- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet - Consectetur adipiscing elit - Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem - Ac tristique libero volutpat at - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit - Phasellus iaculis neque - Purus sodales ultricies - Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem Ac tristique libero volutpat at Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Phasellus iaculis neque Purus sodales ultricies Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Ordered You can create a list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.\nIt is possible to nest lists by indenting an item for the next sublevel.\nMarkdown will automatically number each of your items consecutively. This means, the order number you are providing is irrelevant.\n1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 3. Consectetur adipiscing elit 1. Integer molestie lorem at massa 7. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet 99.

You can also associate more than one term to a definition.\nIf you add empty lines around the definition terms, additional vertical space will be generated. Also multiple paragraphs are possible\nApple : Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae. : An American computer company. Orange : The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus. You can make juice out of it. : A telecommunication company. You can't make juice out of it.

Result In this example, \u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e is marked as code.\nIndented Code Block A simple code block can be generated by indenting several lines of code by at least two spaces.\nBe impressed by my advanced code: // Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Result Be impressed by my advanced code:\n// Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Fenced Code Block If you want to gain more control of your code block you can enclose your code by at least three backticks ``` a so called fence.\nGFM You can also add a language specifier directly after the opening fence, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied according to the selected language in the rendered HTML.\nSee Code Highlighting for additional documentation.\n```js { name: \"Claus\", surname: \"Santa\", profession: \"courier\", age: 666, address: { city: \"North Pole\", postalCode: 1, country: \"Arctic\" }, friends: [ \"Dasher\", \"Dancer\", \"Prancer\", \"Vixen\", \"Comet\", \"Cupid\", \"Donder\", \"Blitzen\", \"Rudolph\" ] }; ``` Result { name: \"Claus\", surname: \"Santa\", profession: \"courier\", age: 666, address: { city: \"North Pole\", postalCode: 1, country: \"Arctic\" }, friends: [ \"Dasher\", \"Dancer\", \"Prancer\", \"Vixen\", \"Comet\", \"Cupid\", \"Donder\", \"Blitzen\", \"Rudolph\" ] }; Tables GFM You can create tables by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | |--------|-------------| | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. | | ext | extension to be used for dest files. | Result Option Description data path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. engine engine to be used for processing templates.

Result This is a link to https://example.com.\nBasic Link You can explicitly define links in case you want to use non-absolute URLs or want to give different text.\n[Assemble](http://assemble.io) Result Assemble\nLink with Tooltip For even further information, you can add an additional text, displayed in a tooltip on hovering over the link.\n[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \"Visit Upstage!\") Result Upstage\nLink References Links can be simplyfied for recurring reuse by using a reference ID to later define the URL location. This simplyfies writing if you want to use a link more than once in a document.\n[Example][somelinkID] [somelinkID]: https://example.com \"Go to example domain\" Result Example\nFootnotes PHP Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things, a marker in the text that will become a superscript number and a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes.\nUsually the list of footnotes will be shown at the end of your document. If we use a footnote in a notice box it will instead be listed at the end of its box.\nFootnotes can contain block elements, which means that you can put multiple paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and so on in a footnote. It works the same as for list items, just indent the following paragraphs by four spaces in the footnote definition.\nThat's some text with a footnote[^1] [^1]: And that's the footnote. That's some more text with a footnote.[^someid] [^someid]: Anything of interest goes here. Blue light glows blue. Result That’s some text with a footnote1\nThat’s some more text with a footnote.2\nAnd that’s the footnote. ↩︎\nAnything of interest goes here.\nBlue light glows blue. ↩︎\nImages Basic Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation mark.\n![Spock](https://octodex.github.com/images/spocktocat.png) Result Image with Tooltip Like links, images can also be given a tooltip.\n![Picard](https://octodex.github.com/images/jean-luc-picat.jpg \"Jean Luc Picard\") Result Image References Images can also be linked by reference ID to later define the URL location. This simplyfies writing if you want to use an image more than once in a document.\n![La Forge][laforge] [laforge]: https://octodex.github.com/images/trekkie.jpg \"Geordi La Forge\" Result Image Effects Relearn This theme allows additional non-standard formatting by setting query parameter at the end of the image URL. See the image effects docs for a detailed example and how to configure it.\nResizing Add query parameter width and/or height to the link image to resize the image. Values are CSS values (default is auto).\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?width=20vw) Result ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px) Result ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px\u0026width=40vw) Result CSS Classes Add a query parameter classes to the link image to add CSS classes.

See the children shortcode for a complete list.\n​ toml yaml json ordersectionsby = 'linktitle' ordersectionsby: linktitle { \"ordersectionsby\": \"linktitle\" } Title for Menu Entries Front Matter A page’s linkTitle or title front matter will be used for naming a menu entry of a page menu, in that order if both are defined. Using linkTitle helps to shorten the text for menu entries if the page’s title is too descriptive.\nMenu A menu entry’s title or name will be used for naming a menu entry of a Hugo menu, in that order if both are defined.\nFor example for a page named install/linux.md\n​ toml yaml json +++ linkTitle = 'Linux' title = 'Install on Linux' +++ --- linkTitle: Linux title: Install on Linux --- { \"linkTitle\": \"Linux\", \"title\": \"Install on Linux\" } Icons for Menu Entries Front Matter For page menus, add a menuPre to insert any HTML code before the menu label. You can also set menuPost to insert HTML code after the menu label.\nMenu For Hugo menus, add a pre to insert any HTML code before the menu label. You can also set post to insert HTML code after the menu label.\nIf pageRef is set for the menu entry and no pre or post was configured, menuPre and menuPost of the referenced page will be taken.\nThe example below uses the GitHub icon for an entry of a page menu.\n​ toml yaml json +++ menuPre = '\u003ci class=\"fab fa-github\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e ' title = 'GitHub Repo' +++ --- menuPre: '\u003ci class=\"fab fa-github\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e ' title: GitHub Repo --- { \"menuPre\": \"\\u003ci class=\\\"fab fa-github\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e \", \"title\": \"GitHub Repo\" } Disable Menu Entries You may want to structure your entries in a hierarchical way but don’t want to generate clickable parent entries? The theme got you covered.\nFor Page Menus To stay with the initial example: Suppose you want first-chapter/first-page appear in the sidebar but don’t want to generate a page for it. So the entry in the sidebar should not be clickable but should be expandable.\nFor this, open content/first-chapter/first-page/_index.md and add the following front matter\n​ toml yaml json +++ [_build] render = 'never' +++ --- _build: render: never --- { \"_build\": { \"render\": \"never\" } } For Hugo Menus Just don’t give your parent menu entry configuration a url or pageRef. See the next section for a special case.\nIf you want to learn how to configure different Hugo menus for each language, see the official docs.\n​ toml yaml json +++ [menu] [[menu.addendum]] name = 'Parent 1' weight = 1 [[menu.addendum]] name = 'Child 1' parent = 'Parent 1' url = 'https://example.com/1' [[menu.addendum]] name = 'Parent 2' weight = 2 [[menu.addendum]] name = 'Child 2' parent = 'Parent 2' url = 'https://example.com/2' +++ --- menu: addendum: - name: Parent 1 weight: 1 - name: Child 1 parent: Parent 1 url: https://example.com/1 - name: Parent 2 weight: 2 - name: Child 2 parent: Parent 2 url: https://example.com/2 --- { \"menu\": { \"addendum\": [ { \"name\": \"Parent 1\", \"weight\": 1 }, { \"name\": \"Child 1\", \"parent\": \"Parent 1\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/1\" }, { \"name\": \"Parent 2\", \"weight\": 2 }, { \"name\": \"Child 2\", \"parent\": \"Parent 2\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/2\" } ] } } Title for Menus Each menu may have an optional title above its tree. This must be activated for each menu by setting disableMenuTitle=false for each sidebar menu configuration.\nFront Matter For page menus, set the menuTitle front matter for the root page of the menu. For example in the home page for the default sidebar menu. If no menuTitle was set, the title will be taken from your translation files by the key \u003cidentifier\u003e-menuTitle, where \u003cidentifier\u003e is the identifier of your sidebar menu configuration.\nMenu For Hugo menus, the title will be taken from your translation files by the key \u003cidentifier\u003e-menuTitle, where \u003cidentifier\u003e is the identifier of your sidebar menu configuration.\nIf you don’t want to fiddle around with your translation files, you also have the possibility to let the title be taken from the menu definition. For that, define a nested menu that only has one top-level entry without url or pageRef.\nIn this case, the title or name is taken for the menu heading.\nIf you want to learn how to configure different Hugo menus for each language, see the official docs.\n​ toml yaml json +++ [menu] [[menu.addendum]] name = 'A Menu Title for the Whole Menu' [[menu.addendum]] name = 'A Menu Entry Title for Child 1' parent = 'Parent' url = 'https://example.com/1' weight = 1 [[menu.addendum]] name = 'A Menu Entry Title for Child 2' parent = 'Parent' url = 'https://example.com/2' weight = 2 +++ --- menu: addendum: - name: A Menu Title for the Whole Menu - name: A Menu Entry Title for Child 1 parent: Parent url: https://example.com/1 weight: 1 - name: A Menu Entry Title for Child 2 parent: Parent url: https://example.com/2 weight: 2 --- { \"menu\": { \"addendum\": [ { \"name\": \"A Menu Title for the Whole Menu\" }, { \"name\": \"A Menu Entry Title for Child 1\", \"parent\": \"Parent\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/1\", \"weight\": 1 }, { \"name\": \"A Menu Entry Title for Child 2\", \"parent\": \"Parent\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/2\", \"weight\": 2 } ] } } Title for the Predefined Shortcut Menu Option By default, the predefined shortcut menu has a the title More (in the English translation).\nYou can disable this title with disableShortcutsTitle=true.\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] disableShortcutsTitle = true params: disableShortcutsTitle: true { \"params\": { \"disableShortcutsTitle\": true } } To change the title, override your translation file.\n​ i18n/en.toml [shortcuts-menuTitle] other = \"Other Great Stuff\" Defining Sidebar Menus Option Front Matter Menus are defined using the sidebarmenus option.\nYou can define as many menus, as you like. If you don’t overwrite this option, the theme defaults to\n​ toml yaml json [[sidebarmenus]] disableTitle = true identifier = 'home' main = true pageRef = '' type = 'page' [[sidebarmenus]] disableTitle = false identifier = 'shortcuts' main = false type = 'menu' sidebarmenus: - disableTitle: true identifier: home main: true pageRef: \"\" type: page - disableTitle: false identifier: shortcuts main: false type: menu { \"sidebarmenus\": [ { \"disableTitle\": true, \"identifier\": \"home\", \"main\": true, \"pageRef\": \"\", \"type\": \"page\" }, { \"disableTitle\": false, \"identifier\": \"shortcuts\", \"main\": false, \"type\": \"menu\" } ] } Parameter Name Default Notes type \u003cempty\u003e The type of menu.\n- page for a page menu\n- menu for a Hugo menu identifier \u003cempty\u003e A unique identifier for this entry\n- for type=page an arbitrary name\n- for page=menu the identifier of the menu definition in your hugo.toml main see notes Whether to add additional spacing and larger text to the menu\n- for type=page defaults to true\n- for page=menu defaults to false disableTitle see notes Whether to print a title above the menu\n- for type=page defaults to true\n- for page=menu defaults to false pageRef \u003cempty\u003e Only for type=page, the page path to start the menu tree. If not set, defaults to the home page. Redefining Sidebar Menus for Certain Pages Suppose you are building a site that contains a topmost blog and documentation section.\nWhen the user is on one of the blog pages he should only see a page menu containing all blog pages, while on a documentation page he should only see a page menu containing all doc pages.\nFor both sections, the default shortcuts Hugo menu should be displayed as if defaults menus were used.\nDirectory structure:\ncontent ├── blog │ ├── post-1.md │ ├── post-2.md │ ├── post-3.md │ └── _index.md ├── docs │ ├── topic-1.md │ ├── topic-2.md │ ├── topic-3.md │ └── _index.md └── _index.md Option Front Matter Using Hugo’s cascade feature, we can redefine the menus once in blog/_index.md and docs/_index.md setting sidebarmenus so they will be used in all children pages.\nSetting the sidebarmenus Front Matter will overwrite all default menus. If you want to display the shortcuts Hugo menu as well like in this example, you have to declare it with the Front Matter as given in the default options.\nblog/_index.md toml yaml json +++ title = 'Blog' [[cascade]] [cascade.params] [[cascade.params.sidebarmenus]] identifier = 'blog' pageRef = '/blog' type = 'page' [[cascade.params.sidebarmenus]] identifier = 'shortcuts' type = 'menu' +++ --- cascade: - params: sidebarmenus: - identifier: blog pageRef: /blog type: page - identifier: shortcuts type: menu title: Blog --- { \"cascade\": [ { \"params\": { \"sidebarmenus\": [ { \"identifier\": \"blog\", \"pageRef\": \"/blog\", \"type\": \"page\" }, { \"identifier\": \"shortcuts\", \"type\": \"menu\" } ] } } ], \"title\": \"Blog\" } docs/_index.md toml yaml json +++ title = 'Documentation' [[cascade]] [cascade.params] [[cascade.params.sidebarmenus]] identifier = 'docs' pageRef = '/docs' type = 'page' [[cascade.params.sidebarmenus]] identifier = 'shortcuts' type = 'menu' +++ --- cascade: - params: sidebarmenus: - identifier: docs pageRef: /docs type: page - identifier: shortcuts type: menu title: Documentation --- { \"cascade\": [ { \"params\": { \"sidebarmenus\": [ { \"identifier\": \"docs\", \"pageRef\": \"/docs\", \"type\": \"page\" }, { \"identifier\": \"shortcuts\", \"type\": \"menu\" } ] } } ], \"title\": \"Documentation\" } Displaying Arbitrary Links in a Page Menu You may have the need to add arbitrary links at some point in your menu that are initially not backed by a page. These are called crosslinks.\nAssume the following structure\ncontent ├── reference │ ├── ref-a.md │ ├── ref-b.md │ ├── ref-c.md │ └── _index.md ├── topic-blue.md ├── topic-red.md ├── topic-yellow.md └── _index.md You now want to include ref-b as separate topic-green entry after topic-blue in your menu.\nFor that create a new page with the following front matter\ncontent/topic-green.md toml yaml json +++ menuPageRef = '/reference/ref-b' title = 'Topic Green' +++ --- menuPageRef: /reference/ref-b title: Topic Green --- { \"menuPageRef\": \"/reference/ref-b\", \"title\": \"Topic Green\" } Front Matter If you want to link to an external page instead, you can use menuUrl instead of menuPageRef.\nPages defining a crosslink are never part of the arrow navigation and are skipped instead.\nSo with the above example and alphabetical sorting of the menu entries, pressing on topic-blue will skip the newly added topic-green and instead will load topic-red.\nHaving sub pages below a page that has menuUrl or menuPageRef set in their front matter is undefined.\nDisplaying Pages Exclusively in a Hugo Menu Sometimes you want to hide pages from the page menu but instead want to show them in a Hugo menu. For that you have two choices\nCreate a headless branch bundle, _index.md in its own folder with the below front matter. The branch bundle will not be contained in the sitemap.\ncontent/showcase/_index.en.md toml yaml json +++ title = 'Showcase' [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = true render = 'always' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: true render: always title: Showcase --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": true, \"render\": \"always\" }, \"title\": \"Showcase\" } Or, put a child page inside a headless branch bundle with the following front matter in the bundle. This causes the child but not the branch bundle to be contained in the sitemap.\ncontent/more/_index.en.md toml yaml json +++ [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = false render = 'never' +++ --- _build: list: never publishResources: false render: never --- { \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": false, \"render\": \"never\" } } The child page can be any type of content.\ncontent/more/credits_index.en.md toml yaml json +++ title = 'Credits' +++ --- title: Credits --- { \"title\": \"Credits\" }",

    "content": "The theme comes with a reasonably configured topbar. You can learn how to configure the defaults in this section.\nNevertheless, your requirements may differ from this configuration. Luckily, the theme has you covered as the topbar, its buttons, and the functionality behind these buttons are fully configurable by you.\nTip All mentioned file names below can be clicked and show you the implementation for a better understanding.\nAreas The default configuration comes with three predefined areas that may contain an arbitrary set of buttons.\nstart: shown between menu and breadcrumb end: shown on the opposite breadcrumb side in comparison to the start area more: shown when pressing the more button in the topbar While you cannot add additional areas in the topbar, you are free to configure additional buttons that behave like the more button, providing further user-defined areas.\nButtons The theme ships with the following predefined buttons (from left to right in the screenshot):\nsidebar: opens the sidebar flyout if in mobile layout toc: opens the table of contents in an overlay edit: browses to the editable page if the editURL parameter is set markdown: browses to the chapter’s markdown source if markdown support was activated print: browses to the chapter’s printable page if print support was activated prev: browses to the previous page if there is one next: browses to the [next page]authoring/frontmatter/topbar(#arrow-navigation) if there is one more: opens the overlay for the more area Not all buttons are displayed at every given time. This is configurable (see below if interested).\nRedefining Areas Each predefined area and button comes in its own file. By that, it is easy for you to overwrite an area file in your installation, reusing only the buttons you like.\nE.g., you can redefine the predefined end area by adding the file layouts/partials/topbar/area/end.html in your installation (not in the theme itself) to remove all but the more button.\nThe below example sets an explicit value for the onempty parameter, overriding the specific default value for this button (these defaults vary depending on the button). The parameter causes the more button to always be displayed instead of hiding once its content is empty.\n{{ partial \"topbar/button/more.html\" (dict \"page\" . \"onempty\" \"disable\" )}} Defining Own Buttons Button Types The theme distinguishes between two types of buttons:\nbutton: a clickable button that either browses to another site, triggers a user-defined script or opens an overlay containing user-defined content area-button: the template for the more button, to define your own area overlay buttons Button Parameter Screen Widths and Actions Depending on the screen width, you can configure how the button should behave. Screen width is divided into three classes:\ns: (controlled by the onwidths parameter) mobile layout where the menu sidebar is hidden m: (controlled by the onwidthm parameter) desktop layout with visible sidebar while the content area width still resizes l: (controlled by the onwidthl parameter) desktop layout with visible sidebar once the content area reached its maximum width For each width class, you can configure one of the following actions:\nshow: the button is displayed in its given area hide: the button is removed area-XXX: the button is moved from its given area into the area XXX; for example, this is used to move buttons to the more area overlay in the mobile layout Hiding and Disabling Stuff While hiding a button depending on the screen size can be configured with the above-described hide action, you may want to hide the button on certain other conditions as well.\nFor example, the print button in its default configuration should only be displayed if print support was configured. This is done in your button template by checking the conditions first before displaying the button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/print.html).\nAnother preferred condition for hiding a button is if the displayed overlay is empty. This is the case for the toc (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/toc.html) as well as the more button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/more.html) and controlled by the parameter onempty.\nThis parameter can have one of the following values:\ndisable: the button is displayed in a disabled state if the overlay is empty hide: the button is removed if the overlay is empty If you want to disable a button containing no overlay, this can be achieved by an empty href parameter. An example can be seen in the prev button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/prev.html) where the URL for the previous site may be empty.\nReference Button Contains the basic button functionality and is used as a base implementation for all other buttons (layouts/partials/topbar/func/button.html).\nCall this from your own button templates if you want to implement a button without an overlay like the print button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/print.html) or with an overlay containing arbitrary content like the toc button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/toc.html).\nFor displaying an area in the button’s overlay, see Area-Button.\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. class \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory unique class name for this button. Displaying two buttons with the same value for class is undefined. href \u003cempty\u003e Either the destination URL for the button or JavaScript code to be executed on click.\n- If starting with javascript: all following text will be executed in your browser\n- Every other string will be interpreted as URL\n- If empty, the button will be displayed in a disabled state regardless of its content icon \u003cempty\u003e Font Awesome icon name. onempty disable Defines what to do with the button if the content parameter was set but ends up empty:\n- disable: The button is displayed in a disabled state.\n- hide: The button is removed. onwidths show The action that should be executed if the site is displayed in the given width:\n- show: The button is displayed in its given area\n- hide: The button is removed.\n- area-XXX: The button is moved from its given area into the area XXX. onwidthm show See above. onwidthl show See above. hint \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary text displayed in the tooltip. title \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary text for the button. content \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary HTML to put into the content overlay.

If you haven’t done any undocumented stuff with the stylesheets, this change should not have any negative effects to your site.\nAnyways, please note that now the variant generator is not included in the theme release anymore but is only available in the exampleSite docs. As a sideeffect, less JavaScript will be loaded on your site.\nNew New As a fallout of fixing the flashing issue, you can now minify the bundled stylesheets by setting the minify parameter in your hugo.toml. Without configuring this parameter, the theme will minify the stylesheets for production (hugo) but not for development (hugo server).\nNew The notice shortcode was improved for accessibility and comes with a brand new parameter groupid.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 11.4.1. This adds support for Kanban diagrams.\nNew Translation into Persian. This language is not supported for search.\n7.1.0 (2024-10-25) Change Change The sidebar menus are now completely configurable.\nThis is provided by the new parameter sidebarmenus. With the new system, you can\nshow arbitrary amounts of menus set headings for each menu base it on your page structure or use Hugo’s menu feature configure a starting page if a menu is based on page structure display unlimited nesting for both menu types reconfigure the menus in a page’s front matter apply the usual parameter alwaysopen, collapsibleMenu, etc. for all menu types You don’t need to change anything in your existing installation as the old configuration is used as a default.\nChange The children shortcode was changed to output a page’s LinkTitle instead of previously using the Title.\nAs the shortcode always outputs subpages in context of the parent page, it functions similar to the sidebar menu. The sidebar menu itself uses the LinkTitle for naming the menu entries and so should the shortcode do.\nThe parameter value sort=linktitle was deprecated for the easier sort=title. You can still use the old value but both behave the same way in sorting by LinkTitle.\nNew New Menus created by your page structure are now able to contain arbitrary links inserted into the structure using the menuUrl or menuPageRef front matter. 7.0.0 (2024-10-15) Hugo 0.126.0 0.126.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version. Breaking Breaking This release comes with significant changes in file naming of partials and how the theme works internally. This was done because the theme\nsuffered from poor build performance for sites with 1000 or more pages reinvented the wheel instead of using available Hugo mechanisms What do I gain, you may ask. A significant performance boost during build! Usually, the build time has been cut at least in half for bigger sites. It is now possible to build even larger sites with 5000 or more pages. This was previously almost impossible due to rapidly increasing build time with the more pages you’ve introduced. For even bigger sites, the theme now has configurable performance optimizations - at the price of feature limitations.\nIf you haven’t done customizations to any partials, you can update right away.\nIf you have customized your templates, in the best cases, you will get build warnings or even errors. In the worst cases, your build succeeds but the site will not work as intended by you.\nSpecifically, you will have to adapt your site if you have\nself-defined output formats self-defined archetypes - now becoming page designs and using Hugo’s content view mechanism overwritten the header.html, menu.html or footer.html partials - needs sync with implementation changes overwritten prev/next topbar buttons - needs sync with implementation changes Breaking This release changes the way the search index and the dedicated search page are generated. This may require reconfiguration by you to still work as you have intended.\nRemove the now obsolete search and searchpage output format from [outputs.home] in your hugo.toml, resulting in something similar to\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'print'] outputs: home: - html - rss - print { \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ] } } After that, your build will succeed but will may cause new defaults to be applied. With no further settings, in-page search, search popup and dedicated search page are all active by default. This can be reconfigured.\nIn addition, you are now able to overwrite the default file name of the search index and the default page name of the dedicated search page by changing searchIndexURL and searchPageURL respectively in your hugo.toml.\nChange Change Once again, the theme changed the font. We switched to the excellent Roboto Flex font.\nCare was taken to configure the font to look similar to the previously used Work Sans. Nevertheless, in direct comparison, you will see slight differences in appearance.\nThis change was necessary as the previously used font had display issues with marked text, contrast, and some other minor stuff. As an aftermath, the number of requests and the download size were decreased when loading a page.\nThe font was created by Google, is licensed under OFL 1.1 and is delivered from your theme’s installation. As always, no third-party server calls are involved.\nIf you have changed the font-family in your installation, you most likely have to adjust the variables --MAIN-font-weight, --MAIN-BOLD-font-weight and --MAIN-letter-spacing.\nAdditionally, if you have changed the font to a variable font in your installation, you may have to adjust the variable --MAIN-font-variation-settings. As this only applies to variable fonts, this should rarely be necessary.\nChange While switching the font, it was discovered that certain CSS variables were falsely named. You don’t need to change anything in your custom variant stylesheet as the old names will be used as a fallback.\n--MAIN-TITLES-TEXT-font was renamed to --MAIN-TITLES-font, --MAIN-TITLES-H\u003cn\u003e-color was renamed to --MAIN-TITLES-H\u003cn\u003e-TEXT-color.\nChange The options and front matter to force loading a math, mermaid or openapi library has been changed.\nPreviously, you had to set the unintuitive disableMathJax=false to force load the math library in case of a passthrough configuration. This is replaced by the simpler math=true or math.force=true and is now in line with Hugo’s official documentation.\nYou don’t need to change anything yet but will receive warnings if the old settings are used.\nChange The default logo is not contained inside of the theme’s logo partial anymore.\nThis is to avoid usage of the theme’s branding throughout the web in non-modified installations.\nIn addition, the default text for the logo partial is now taken from the linkTitle setting of your hugo.toml.\nNew New The docs received a much-needed overhaul for all chapters.\nBasically, the structure was reorganized, giving each topic its own page while keeping the amount of items for each menu level comprehensible by adding sub-pages.\nThe docs now clearly differentiate between configuration of your site, all things writing page content and the shortcodes docs that cover both topics, configuration and usage.\nTo give you a better overview of what’s possible with the theme, we introduced reference pages for all theme configuration options and front matter and mark each occurrence of such on all pages with the badges Option and Front Matter.\nAlso, a lot of previously undocumented features are now included, namely\nthe hidden pages feature options of the menus configuring breadcrumb, titles and headings of your content options for using links adding custom output formats Version 6 6.4.0 (2024-10-11) Change Change If you now display a single code block in a notice box, its margin and border will be removed so only the colored notice border is visible. New New It is now possible to have user-defined styles for all shortcodes that accept the style parameter. See the notice shortcode for configuration.\nNew The resources shortcode has a new parameter expanded to make the resource list collapsible.\n6.3.0 (2024-09-03) Change Change The expand shortcode changed the naming of the open parameter to expanded. You don’t need to change anything yet but may get deprecation warnings.\nChange If the content for the notice shortcode is empty, now only the title bar will be displayed. Previously an empty content box was displayed.\nNew New The notice shortcode has a new parameter expanded to make the content collapsible.\nNew If you are running Hugo 0.134.0 or later, the theme now supports Obsidian callouts.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 11.1.0. This adds support for packet and architecture diagrams.\n6.2.0 (2024-08-26) Change Change The heading anchor links are extended in functionality.\nIf you now click on it, not only is the link copied to the clipboard (previous behavior) but also the heading scrolls to the top of the page.\nIf you dislike the new behavior, you can deactivate it by setting disableAnchorScrolling=true in your hugo.toml. See the docs for further options.\nNew New If you are running Hugo 0.132.0 or later, the theme is now capable to print GitHub alerts.\nNew To support new severity levels for GitHub alerts, all shortcodes that support severity levels with their style parameter were expanded with the new severities caution and important and the color parameter was expanded with cyan and magenta. Please note, that coloring and icons of severities may defer from the display you see on GitHub.\nNew To support new severity levels for GitHub alerts, the new severities and their according colors are also available as CSS variables BOX-MAGENTA-color, BOX-MAGENTA-TEXT-color, BOX-CAUTION-color, BOX-CAUTION-TEXT-color, BOX-CYAN-color, BOX-CYAN-TEXT-color, BOX-IMPORTANT-color, BOX-IMPORTANT-TEXT-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as appropriate default colors will be used.\n6.1.0 (2024-08-02) Change Change The include shortcode is now able to resolve links to pages as well as resources or files in the file system (the old behavior).\nChange To make the asset buster mechanism more robust, some internally used stylesheets where restructured. This generally should not affect your page in any negative way.\nNew New The openapi shortcode is now able to resolve links to resources as well as to files in the file system (the old behavior). You can configure to generate warnings or errors during build by setting openapi.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml if a path can not be resolved.\nNew Shortcodes supporting an errorlevel configuration can now have overridden values in the front matter section of each individual page.\nNew The theme now comes with its own overridden version of the relref shortcode.\nWhile the usage of relref is obsolete and discouraged by Hugo for a while, existing installations may use it. In configurations using a baseURL with a subdirectory, and having relativeURLs=false (the default) Hugo’s standard relref implementation was failing.\nThe shortcode is deactivated by default and can be activated by setting\nhugo. toml yaml json [params] disableDefaultRelref = true params: disableDefaultRelref: true { \"params\": { \"disableDefaultRelref\": true } } in your hugo.toml. Only do this if your site fulfills all of the above assumptions.\n6.0.0 (2024-04-27) Breaking Breaking This release requires you to move your self-defined variant (theme-*.css) and chroma stylesheets (chroma-*.css) from static/css to assets/css.\nThis was necessary to avoid permission errors on build if running in certain Unix configurations.\nIn addition it is not allowed anymore to @import your chroma stylesheet from inside of your variant stylesheet.\nSay, your chroma stylesheet is named chroma-monokai.css, you have to add the following inside your variant stylesheet:\n--CODE-theme: monokai; Breaking The parameter description in your hugo.toml will now be ignored.\nWith the newly introduced unified handling of descriptions throughout the theme, the only place the old parameter would have been used was your home page.\nFor migration, move the description parameter of your hugo.toml into the front matter section of your home page.\nBreaking Search support for the json outputformat deprecated in 5.4.0 was removed.\nChange it to search for the homepage in your hugo.toml. See the docs for detailed configuration.\nBreaking The front matter option menuTitle deprecated in 5.24.0 was removed in favor for Hugo’s own linkTitle.\nAdditionally, if set, linkTitle will now be used instead of title to generate the breadcrumb.\nBreaking The swagger shortcode deprecated in 5.13.0 was removed in favor for the openapi shortcode with the same set of parameter.\nBreaking Support for Internet Explorer 11 was finally dropped.\nChange Change With the removal of support for Internet Explorer 11, Font Awesome was upgraded to version 6.5.2.\nYou may experience slight changes for some icons. In addition you have additional ~1700 icons to chose from.\nChange The children shortcode was fixed to adhere to its documentation, generating the description based on this rule: When no description or summary exists for the page, the first 70 words of the content is taken.\nPreviously, the summary erroneously was ignored which now can lead to different output if you set description=true as a parameter.\nNew New The include shortcode is now able to resolve links to resources as well as to files in the file system (the old behavior). You can configure to generate warnings or errors during build by setting include.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml if a path can not be resolved.\nNew Math is now usable without enclosing it in a shortcode or Markdown codefence by using Hugo’s passthrough configuration.\nNew Translation into Romanian.\nOlder Versions Version 5 Version 4 Version 3 Version 2 Version 1",

If you instead want to provide a new output format, the theme got you covered as well.\nA page is displayed by exactly one page design for each output format, is represented by Hugo’s reserved type front matter and uses Hugo’s content view mechanism.\nA page design usually consists of\none or more content view files: depending on the output format taken from the list below an optional archetype file: a template for creating new Markdown files with the correct setting for the type front matter and any furhter parameter optional CSS styles Warning Don’t use Hugo’s reserved type option in your modifications for other functionality!\nUsing a Page Design Regardless of shipped or custom page designs, you are using them in the same way. Either by manually setting the type front matter to the value of the page design or by using an archetype during creation of a new page.\nIf no type is set in your front matter or the page design doesn’t exist for a given output format, the page is treated as if type='default' was set.\nThe Relearn theme ships with the page designs home, chapter, and default for the HTML output format.\nThe shipped print and markdown output formats only display using the default page design.\nCreating a Page Design Suppose you are writing a documentation site for some software.

If this is not enough, this page describes how you can create your own output formats.\nIf you instead just want to customize the layout of an existing output format, the theme got you covered as well.\nCreating an Output Format Suppose you want to be able to send your articles as HTML formatted emails.

    "content": "Semver This project tries to follow the semver policy - although not followed 100% in the past.\nUsually an entry of Breaking on the What’s new page causes a new major release number.\nAll other entries on the What’s new page will increase the minor release number.\nReleases resulting in a new major or minor number are called main release.\nReleases containing bugfixes only, are only increasing the patch release number. Those releases don’t result in announcements on the What’s new page.\nEntries on the What’s new page are checked and enforced during the version-release GitHub Action.\nManaging Issues Issues are categorized and managed by assigning labels to it.\nOnce working on an issue, assign it to a fitting maintainer.\nWhen done, close the ticket. Once an issue is closed, it needs to be assigned to next release milestone.\nA once released ticket is not allowed to be reopened and rereleased in a different milestone. This would cause the changelog to be changed even for the milestone the issue was previously released in. Instead write a new ticket.\nManaging Pull Requests If a PR is merged and closed it needs an accompanied issue assigned to. If there is no issue for a PR, the maintainer needs to create one.\nYou can assign multiple PRs to one issue as long as they belong together.\nUsually set the same labels and milestone for the PR as for the accompanied issue.\nLabels Kind An issue that results in changesets must have exactly one of the following labels. This needs to be assigned latest before release.\nLabel Description Changelog section documentation Improvements or additions to documentation - discussion This issue was converted to a discussion - task Maintenance work Maintenance feature New feature or request Features bug Something isn’t working Fixes Impact If the issue would cause a new main release due to semver semantics it needs one of the according labels and the matching badge on the What’s new page.\nLabel Description change Introduces changes with existing installations breaking Introduces breaking changes with existing installations Declination If an issue does not result in changesets but is closed anyways, it must have exactly one of the following labels.\nLabel Description duplicate This issue or pull request already exists invalid This doesn’t seem right support Request for achieving a special goal unresolved No progress on this issue update A change in behavior after updat wontchange This will not be worked on Halt You can assign one further label out of the following list to signal readers that development on an open issue is currently halted for different reasons.\nLabel Description blocked Depends on other issue to be fixed first idea A valuable idea that’s currently not worked on undecided No decision was made yet helpwanted Great idea, send in a PR needsfeedback Further information is needed 3rd-Party If the issue is not caused by a programming error in the themes own code, you can label the causing program or library.\nLabel Description asciidoc This is a topic related to processing of AsciiDoc browser This is a topic related to the browser but not the theme device This is a topic related to a certain device hugo This is a topic related to Hugo itself but not the theme mermaid This is a topic related to Mermaid itself but not the theme Setting Up a Development Environment Git Hooks are used to automate some tasks. They are stored in the .githooks root folder.\nDocumentation for each hook is contained in each file.\nAt least the pre-commit hook is required, as it updates the version number on each commit. This helps to help debugging of user related issues.\nMaking Releases A release is based on a milestone named like the release itself - just the version number, eg: 1.2.3. It’s in the maintainers responsibility to check semver semantics of the milestone’s name prior to release and change it if necessary.\nMaking releases is automated by the version-release GitHub Action. It requires the version number of the milestone that should be released. The release will be created from the main branch of the repository.\nTreat released milestones as immutable. Don’t rerelease an already released milestone. An already released milestone may already been consumed by your users.\nDuring execution of the action a few things are checked. If a check fails the action fails, resulting in no new release. You can correct the errors afterwards and rerun the action.\nThe following checks will be enforced\nthe milestone exists there is at least one closed issue assigned to the milestone all assigned issues for this milestone are closed if it’s a main release, there must be an accompanying releasenotes file present in the repo at introduction/releasenotes/\u003cmajor\u003e/\u003cminor\u003e.en.md After a successful run of the action\nthe changelog at introduction/changelog/\u003cmajor\u003e/\u003cminor\u003e/\u003cpatch\u003e.\u003clang\u003e.md is created for english and piratish, including missing generic upper level files the CHANGELOG.md is updated the releasenotes at introduction/releasenotes/\u003cmajor\u003e/\u003cminor\u003e.en.md are updated, including release version and release date missing generic upper level files for english and piratish are created the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated the updated files are committed the milestone is closed the repository is tagged with the version number (eg. 1.2.3), the main version number (eg. 1.2.x) and the major version number (eg. 1.x) a new entry in the GitHub release list with the according changelog will be created the official documentation is built and deployed the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated to a temporary and committed (this helps to determine if users are running directly on the main branch or are using releases) a new milestone for the next patch release is created (this can later be renamed to a main release if necessary)",

Settings Providing Initialization Options for the MathJax Library Option Front Matter The MathJax library is configured with default settings for initialization.\nYou can overwrite the settings by providing a JSON object in mathJaxInitialize. See MathJax’s documentation for all allowed settings.\nKeep in mind that initialization settings of your pages front matter overwrite all settings of your configuration options.\n​ toml yaml json mathJaxInitialize = '{ \"chtml\": { \"displayAlign\": \"left\" }, { \"tex\": { \"inlineMath\": [[\"\\(\", \"\\)\"], [\"@\", \"@\"]], displayMath: [[\"\\[\", \"\\]\"], [\"@@\", \"@@\"]] }, \"options\": { \"enableMenu\": false }' mathJaxInitialize: '{ \"chtml\": { \"displayAlign\": \"left\" }, { \"tex\": { \"inlineMath\": [[\"\\(\", \"\\)\"], [\"@\", \"@\"]], displayMath: [[\"\\[\", \"\\]\"], [\"@@\", \"@@\"]] }, \"options\": { \"enableMenu\": false }' { \"mathJaxInitialize\": \"{ \\\"chtml\\\": { \\\"displayAlign\\\": \\\"left\\\" }, { \\\"tex\\\": { \\\"inlineMath\\\": [[\\\"\\\\(\\\", \\\"\\\\)\\\"], [\\\"@\\\", \\\"@\\\"]], displayMath: [[\\\"\\\\[\\\", \\\"\\\\]\\\"], [\\\"@@\\\", \\\"@@\\\"]] }, \\\"options\\\": { \\\"enableMenu\\\": false }\" } Loading an External Version of the MathJax Library Option Front Matter The theme uses the shipped MathJax library by default.\nIn case you want do use a different version of the MathJax library but don’t want to override the shipped version, you can set customMathJaxURL to the URL of the external MathJax library.\n​ toml yaml json customMathJaxURL = 'https://unpkg.com/mathjax/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js' customMathJaxURL: https://unpkg.com/mathjax/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js { \"customMathJaxURL\": \"https://unpkg.com/mathjax/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js\" } Force Loading of the MathJax Library Option Front Matter The MathJax library will be loaded if the page contains a math shortcode or codefence.\nYou can force loading the MathJax library if no shortcode or codefence was used by setting math=true. If a shortcode or codefence was found, the option has no effect. This must be set in case you are using the passthrough configuration to render math.\nInstead of math=true you can also use the alias math.force=true.\n​ toml yaml json math = true math: true { \"math\": true } Passthrough Configuration You can use your math without enclosing it in a shortcode or codefence by using a passthrough configuration\nhugo. toml yaml json [markup] [markup.goldmark] [markup.goldmark.extensions] [markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough] enable = true [markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough.delimiters] block = [['\\[', '\\]'], ['$$', '$$']] inline = [['\\(', '\\)'], ['$', '$']] markup: goldmark: extensions: passthrough: delimiters: block: - - \\[ - \\] - - $$ - $$ inline: - - \\( - \\) - - $ - $ enable: true { \"markup\": { \"goldmark\": { \"extensions\": { \"passthrough\": { \"delimiters\": { \"block\": [ [ \"\\\\[\", \"\\\\]\" ], [ \"$$\", \"$$\" ] ], \"inline\": [ [ \"\\\\(\", \"\\\\)\" ], [ \"$\", \"$\" ] ] }, \"enable\": true } } } } } In this case you have to force load the MathJax library either in your hugo.toml or in your page’s front matter as the theme doesn’t know if math is used.\nSee the example on how a passthrough configurations makes using math really easy.\nExamples Passthrough Block Math With passthrough configuration enabled you can just drop your math without enclosing it by shortcodes or codefences but no other parameters are available.\nIn this case you have to force load the MathJax library by setting math=true either in your hugo.toml or in your page’s front matter.\nIn passthrough default configuration, block math is generated if you use two consecutive $$ as a delimiter around your formulae.\n$$\\left| \\begin{array}{cc} a \u0026 b \\\\ c \u0026 d \\end{array}\\right|$$ $$\\left| \\begin{array}{cc} a \u0026 b \\\\ c \u0026 d \\end{array}\\right|$$Passthrough Inline Math The same usage restrictions as of the previous example apply here as well.\nIn passthrough default configuration, inline math is generated if you use a single $ as a delimiter around your formulae.\nEuclid already knew, $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Euclid already knew, $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\nCodefence Block Math with Right Alignment If you are using codefences, more parameter are available. Your formulae still needs to be enclosed by $ or $$ as delimiters respectively.\n```math {align=\"right\"} $$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$ ``` $$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$ Shortcode Block Math with Right Alignment You can also use shortcode syntax.

To set the theme globally edit the --MERMAID-theme variable of your color variant.\nKeep in mind that initialization settings of your pages front matter overwrite all settings of your configuration options.\nIn addition, you can merge settings for each individual graph through diagram directives on top of the settings of your page’s front matter or configuration options.\n​ toml yaml json mermaidInitialize = '{ \"securityLevel\": \"loose\" }' mermaidInitialize: '{ \"securityLevel\": \"loose\" }' { \"mermaidInitialize\": \"{ \\\"securityLevel\\\": \\\"loose\\\" }\" } Loading an External Version of the Mermaid Library Option Front Matter The theme uses the shipped Mermaid library by default.\nIn case you want do use a different version of the Mermaid library but don’t want to override the shipped version, you can set customMermaidURL to the URL of the external Mermaid library.\n​ toml yaml json customMermaidURL = 'https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js' customMermaidURL: https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js { \"customMermaidURL\": \"https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js\" } Force Loading of the Mermaid Library Option Front Matter The Mermaid library will be loaded if the page contains an mermaid shortcode or codefence.\nYou can force loading the Mermaid library if no shortcode or codefence was used by setting mermaid.force=true. If a shortcode or codefence was found, this option has no effect. This comes handy in case you are using scripting to render a graph.\n​ toml yaml json [mermaid] force = true mermaid: force: true { \"mermaid\": { \"force\": true } } Setting a Specific Mermaid Theme While you can configure the Mermaid theme to render your graph by using one of the initialization options, the recommended way is to set the default value using the --MERMAID-theme variable in your color variant stylesheet.

If you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may have to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) in your partial. For a reference take a look into the menu-footer.html partial that is coming with the exampleSite.\nThis change was made to allow your own menu footer to be placed right after the so called prefooter that comes with the theme (containing the language switch and Clear history functionality).\nBreaking We have changed the default colors from the original Learn theme (the purple menu header) to the Relearn defaults (the light green menu header) as used in the official documentation.\nThis change will only affect your installation if you’ve not set the themeVariant parameter in your hugo.toml. If you still want to use the Learn color variant, you have to explicitly set themeVariant=\"learn\" in your hugo.toml.\nNote, that this will also affect your site if viewed with Internet Explorer 11 but in this case it can not be reconfigured as Internet Explorer does not support CSS variables.\nChange Change Due to a bug, that we couldn’t fix in a general manner for color variants, we decided to remove --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-ICONS-color and introduced --MENU-SEARCH-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange For consistency reasons, we renamed --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-color to --MENU-SEARCH-BORDER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew New With this release you are now capable to define your own dark mode variants.\nTo make this possible, we have introduced a lot more color variables you can use in your color variants. Your old variants will still work and don’t need to be changed as appropriate fallback values are used by the theme. Nevertheless, the new colors allow for much more customization.\nTo see what’s now possible, see the new variants relearn-dark and neon that are coming with this release.\nNew To make the creation of new variants easier for you, we’ve added a new interactive theme variant generator. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\nNew You can now configure multiple color variants in your hugo.toml. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer. See the documentation for configuration.\nNote, that the new variant selector will not work with Internet Explorer 11 as it does not support CSS variables. Therefore, the variant selector will not be displayed with Internet Explorer 11.",

Breaking Breaking This release comes with significant changes in file naming of partials and how the theme works internally. This was done because the theme\nsuffered from poor build performance for sites with 1000 or more pages reinvented the wheel instead of using available Hugo mechanisms What do I gain, you may ask. A significant performance boost during build! Usually, the build time has been cut at least in half for bigger sites. It is now possible to build even larger sites with 5000 or more pages. This was previously almost impossible due to rapidly increasing build time with the more pages you’ve introduced. For even bigger sites, the theme now has configurable performance optimizations - at the price of feature limitations.\nIf you haven’t done customizations to any partials, you can update right away.\nIf you have customized your templates, in the best cases, you will get build warnings or even errors. In the worst cases, your build succeeds but the site will not work as intended by you.\nSpecifically, you will have to adapt your site if you have\nself-defined output formats self-defined archetypes - now becoming page designs and using Hugo’s content view mechanism overwritten the header.html, menu.html or footer.html partials - needs sync with implementation changes overwritten prev/next topbar buttons - needs sync with implementation changes Breaking This release changes the way the search index and the dedicated search page are generated. This may require reconfiguration by you to still work as you have intended.\nRemove the now obsolete search and searchpage output format from [outputs.home] in your hugo.toml, resulting in something similar to\nhugo. toml yaml json [outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'print'] outputs: home: - html - rss - print { \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ] } } After that, your build will succeed but will may cause new defaults to be applied. With no further settings, in-page search, search popup and dedicated search page are all active by default. This can be reconfigured.\nIn addition, you are now able to overwrite the default file name of the search index and the default page name of the dedicated search page by changing searchIndexURL and searchPageURL respectively in your hugo.toml.\nChange Change Once again, the theme changed the font. We switched to the excellent Roboto Flex font.\nCare was taken to configure the font to look similar to the previously used Work Sans. Nevertheless, in direct comparison, you will see slight differences in appearance.\nThis change was necessary as the previously used font had display issues with marked text, contrast, and some other minor stuff. As an aftermath, the number of requests and the download size were decreased when loading a page.\nThe font was created by Google, is licensed under OFL 1.1 and is delivered from your theme’s installation. As always, no third-party server calls are involved.\nIf you have changed the font-family in your installation, you most likely have to adjust the variables --MAIN-font-weight, --MAIN-BOLD-font-weight and --MAIN-letter-spacing.\nAdditionally, if you have changed the font to a variable font in your installation, you may have to adjust the variable --MAIN-font-variation-settings. As this only applies to variable fonts, this should rarely be necessary.\nChange While switching the font, it was discovered that certain CSS variables were falsely named. You don’t need to change anything in your custom variant stylesheet as the old names will be used as a fallback.\n--MAIN-TITLES-TEXT-font was renamed to --MAIN-TITLES-font, --MAIN-TITLES-H\u003cn\u003e-color was renamed to --MAIN-TITLES-H\u003cn\u003e-TEXT-color.\nChange The options and front matter to force loading a math, mermaid or openapi library has been changed.\nPreviously, you had to set the unintuitive disableMathJax=false to force load the math library in case of a passthrough configuration. This is replaced by the simpler math=true or math.force=true and is now in line with Hugo’s official documentation.\nYou don’t need to change anything yet but will receive warnings if the old settings are used.\nChange The default logo is not contained inside of the theme’s logo partial anymore.\nThis is to avoid usage of the theme’s branding throughout the web in non-modified installations.\nIn addition, the default text for the logo partial is now taken from the linkTitle setting of your hugo.toml.\nNew New The docs received a much-needed overhaul for all chapters.\nBasically, the structure was reorganized, giving each topic its own page while keeping the amount of items for each menu level comprehensible by adding sub-pages.\nThe docs now clearly differentiate between configuration of your site, all things writing page content and the shortcodes docs that cover both topics, configuration and usage.\nTo give you a better overview of what’s possible with the theme, we introduced reference pages for all theme configuration options and front matter and mark each occurrence of such on all pages with the badges Option and Front Matter.\nAlso, a lot of previously undocumented features are now included, namely\nthe hidden pages feature options of the menus configuring breadcrumb, titles and headings of your content options for using links adding custom output formats",
